## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Overall Completeness: 78% of questions fully answered

The Business Intelligence discovery session was comprehensive and well-documented, covering all major BI capabilities (dashboards, reporting, saved searches, workbook analytics, SuiteQL). The session successfully identified the core pain point ("singing from different songbooks") and established 27 discrete requirements. However, **critical implementation details** remain undefined across 6 major areas requiring targeted follow-up.

### Critical Gaps
1. **Export Security Policy** - No decision on which roles can export; notification recipients undefined
2. **Official Report Definitions** - Complete inventory of reports and governance process needed
3. **Dashboard Specifications** - KPIs, metrics, and lock-down decisions per department undefined
4. **Organizational Hierarchy** - Current structure not documented; maintenance process unclear
5. **Process-Specific Reports** - Backlog 360, Bookings 360, Account Manager status report specs needed
6. **Scorecard Metrics** - Sales rep scorecard detailed metrics beyond revenue/GP undefined

### Follow-up Sessions Needed: 4 required sessions + 5 optional department-specific sessions

### Estimated Timeline: 6-8 weeks to achieve 100% questionnaire coverage
- Week 1-2: Export Security Policy and Official Reports sessions
- Week 3-4: Organizational Hierarchy documentation and Scorecard Design
- Week 5-6: Process-specific report specifications (Backlog 360, Bookings 360)
- Week 7-8: Dashboard design sessions by department (5 sessions)

## DECISION LOG EXCERPT

### New/Updated Decisions from This Analysis

**DECISION-BI-NEW-01**: Four Critical Follow-Up Sessions Required  
**Date**: 2025-10-23  
**Decision**: Schedule and conduct four mandatory follow-up sessions (Export Security Policy, Official Reports Definition, Org Hierarchy & Scorecards, Process-Specific Reports) to address critical gaps before proceeding to solution design  
**Rationale**: 22% of questions not answered, 68% partially answered. Critical implementation details missing for 6 ACCOMMODATE requirements requiring custom development. Cannot build without specifications.  
**Impact**: 4-week extension to discovery phase, but prevents rework later. Better to get specs right now than build wrong solution.  
**Approach**: ADAPT - Normal discovery refinement process

**DECISION-BI-NEW-02**: Optional Dashboard Design Sessions Recommended but Not Required  
**Date**: 2025-10-23  
**Decision**: Five optional dashboard design sessions (one per department) recommended for optimal adoption but can be deferred if timeline/budget constrained. High-level dashboard specs from critical sessions sufficient to start implementation.  
**Rationale**: Dashboard details can be refined during implementation based on initial builds. Not critical path blockers.  
**Impact**: If deferred, dashboards may require iteration post-go-live. If conducted, higher initial adoption.  
**Approach**: Project management decision based on timeline/budget

**DECISION-BI-NEW-03**: Export Security Policy is Critical Path  
**Date**: 2025-10-23  
**Decision**: Export Security Policy Definition session (Session 1) must be completed before role configuration begins. This is a security control, not a nice-to-have.  
**Rationale**: Explicit concern raised during discovery about customer data theft risk. Implementing without security controls creates vulnerability window. Legal/compliance implications possible.  
**Impact**: Blocks REQ-011 and REQ-012 implementation until complete  
**Approach**: ACCOMMODATE - Custom notification workflow requires specifications

**DECISION-BI-NEW-04**: "Singing from Same Songbook" is Core Success Factor  
**Date**: 2025-10-23  
**Decision**: Official Reports Definition workshop (Session 2) is highest priority follow-up. This solves the primary pain point driving the BI requirements. Without this, risk of perpetuating "Mark's version, Matt's version, Kip's version" problem in new system.  
**Rationale**: Trust in reporting is fundamental to system adoption. Clear from transcript this is THE problem to solve ("constant problem... people don't trust the reporting").  
**Impact**: Blocks REQ-008 and REQ-010 implementation. Influences entire BI strategy.  
**Approach**: ADAPT - Requires business process change (governance and standards)

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Discovery Process Observations

**Strengths:**
1. Comprehensive initial session covering all BI topics
2. Strong engagement from client (Lorraine, Wendy, others participated)
3. Clear identification of core pain point ("singing from different songbooks")
4. Good balance of conceptual discussion and specific examples
5. Questionnaire properly identified outstanding items and organic questions
6. Requirements Map shows excellent traceability

**Improvement Opportunities:**
1. **Pre-work could have accelerated decisions**: If clients brought current report examples and org chart to initial session, some gaps could have been addressed
2. **More end-user representation**: Initial session had leadership (Lorraine, Wendy) but not Account Managers, operations team, finance team members who will use BI daily
3. **Dashboard mockups**: Showing visual mockups earlier could have prompted more specific KPI discussions

### Prioritization Recommendation

**If timeline/budget constrained, recommend this sequence:**

**Phase 1 - Must-Do (Weeks 1-4):**
- Session 1: Export Security Policy
- Session 2: Official Reports Definition
- Session 3: Org Hierarchy & Scorecards
- Session 4: Process-Specific Reports
- Result: 95% questionnaire complete, all critical gaps resolved

**Phase 2 - Should-Do (Weeks 5-7):**
- Sessions 5-9: Dashboard Design by Department (at least Finance and Sales)
- Result: 98% complete, high-priority gaps resolved

**Phase 3 - Nice-to-Have (Weeks 7-8 or during implementation):**
- Session 10: Integration Strategy
- Session 11: Executive Dashboard
- Additional dashboard sessions for remaining departments
- Result: 100% complete

**Alternate Approach if Highly Constrained:**
- Do only Sessions 1-4 (Critical)
- Use high-level requirements from those sessions to build initial dashboards
- Refine dashboards iteratively during implementation based on user feedback
- Trade-off: Faster to implementation, but may require dashboard rework

### Change Management Focus Areas

Based on gaps analysis, these are highest-risk change management areas:

1. **Dashboard Lock-Down (REQ-003)**: "I changed my dashboard - No you're not doing that" - Users will resist loss of control. Needs strong manager communication.

2. **Official Reports Only (REQ-008)**: Users creating "Mark's version, Matt's version, Kip's version" must stop. Requires governance enforcement and alternative outlet (private searches).

3. **Daily Reminders Adoption (REQ-006)**: Changing daily workflow to start with reminders portlet. Needs training and reinforcement.

4. **Export Security (REQ-011)**: Some users will lose export capability they currently have. Needs business justification communication ("prevent customer data theft").

5. **Real-Time Mindset**: Shifting from static Excel snapshots to live dashboards that change throughout the day. Requires mindset change about what "reporting" means.

**Recommendation**: Develop change management communication plan specifically addressing these 5 areas with "why this matters" business justification for each.

### Appendix B: Requirements Blocked by Gaps

**Critical Path Blockers:**
- REQ-011: Role-based export permissions (GAP-001)
- REQ-012: Export notification workflow (GAP-001) [Custom Development]
- REQ-008: Official report designation (GAP-002)
- REQ-010: Report criteria documentation (GAP-002)
- REQ-023: Org structure configuration (GAP-003)
- REQ-022: "Me and my team" filters (GAP-003)
- REQ-020: Sales rep scorecards (GAP-003, GAP-007) [Custom Development]
- REQ-021: Manager scorecards (GAP-003, GAP-007) [Custom Development]
- REQ-026: Backlog 360 dashboard (GAP-004) [Custom Development]
- REQ-027: Bookings 360 dashboard (GAP-004) [Custom Development]
- **Account Manager Status Report** (GAP-004) [Not yet assigned REQ number]

**Total**: 11 requirements (10 with REQ numbers + 1 to be added) blocked by critical gaps

**Custom Development Blocked**: 5 requirements (REQ-012, REQ-020, REQ-021, REQ-026, REQ-027) cannot start development until specs complete

### Appendix C: Session Sequencing Rationale

**Why Session 1 (Export Security) is first:**
- Security control - should be in place before widespread system use
- Simpler decision set - easier warm-up for more complex sessions
- IT Security can work independently if other stakeholders unavailable

**Why Session 2 (Official Reports) is second:**
- Largest scope - needs dedicated time
- Informs all other sessions (dashboards will reference official reports)
- Solves core pain point - demonstrates value early

**Why Session 3 (Org Hierarchy & Scorecards) is third:**
- Org structure must be correct before scorecards can be built
- Scorecard design benefits from org structure discussion being fresh
- Combines two related topics efficiently (both involve hierarchy)

**Why Session 4 (Process-Specific Reports) is fourth:**
- Order Management specific - narrower audience
- Custom development specs - detailed technical discussion
- Can leverage official reports from Session 2

**Why Sessions 5-9 (Dashboard Design) are optional:**
- Can build basic dashboards from high-level requirements
- Iteration possible post-go-live
- Most time-intensive (5 sessions)
- Not blocking other implementation work

## CONCLUSION

The Business Intelligence & Reporting discovery session was **comprehensive and high-quality**, successfully identifying all major requirements and the core pain point ("singing from different songbooks"). The questionnaire is **78% complete** with strong conceptual understanding across all BI capabilities.

However, **critical implementation details are missing** across 16 identified gaps, with **4 critical gaps blocking 11 requirements** including 5 requiring custom development. These gaps are not unusual for initial discovery but must be resolved before proceeding to solution design and development.

**Four mandatory follow-up sessions** (8-10 hours total client time) will resolve all critical gaps and bring questionnaire to **95% complete**. Five additional optional sessions (7.5 hours client time) will achieve **98-100% complete** and reduce post-go-live iteration.

The **most critical follow-up is Session 2 (Official Reports Definition)** as it directly addresses the primary pain point and informs all subsequent BI work. Without this session, implementation team lacks the specifications needed to build the reporting framework that will restore trust in data and enable "singing from the same songbook."

**Recommended timeline**: 6-8 weeks to complete all follow-up sessions and achieve 100% questionnaire coverage. Critical path allows starting implementation work after Week 4 (Session 4 complete) with dashboard refinement continuing in parallel.
