that's.","startTime":"16:18","endTime":"16:20","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I mean, obviously this is.","startTime":"16:22","endTime":"16:25","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"This is a pain point for us.","startTime":"16:25","endTime":"16:26","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"When we invoice, have we fulfilled our part enough to send the invoice?","startTime":"16:29","endTime":"16:34","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then the client doesn't want the invoice.","startTime":"16:34","endTime":"16:36","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's not installed.","startTime":"16:36","endTime":"16:37","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And it's like.","startTime":"16:37","endTime":"16:38","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Well, we don't recognize invoice on installation.","startTime":"16:38","endTime":"16:40","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We call on shipment.","startTime":"16:40","endTime":"16:42","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So there's so gray area in there.","startTime":"16:42","endTime":"16:44","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And frankly, we manipulate those sales invoices of when we send them out, when we stuff like that.","startTime":"16:45","endTime":"16:51","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So what I'm curious again, reading all this, you know, laid out in black and white, is this very systematic?","startTime":"16:51","endTime":"16:58","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Now, is this kind, you know, or is there.","startTime":"16:58","endTime":"17:00","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Is there still an ability to have the human interaction intervention, that type stuff?","startTime":"17:01","endTime":"17:07","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Well, the way that NetSuite recognizes revenue and cost is pretty locked in, but you do have control of the timing of when those transactions occur.","startTime":"17:09","endTime":"17:19","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Now, you mentioned something just a moment ago about there being a gray area in regards to when that client will allow you to invoice, we do have a commercial agreement record solution that we've been working on, and in that record, it kind of ties to the invoice schedule.","startTime":"17:20","endTime":"17:40","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And in that record, we allow you to define for that customer.","startTime":"17:40","endTime":"17:44","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"What's that field called, Chris?","startTime":"17:46","endTime":"17:48","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Is it?","startTime":"17:48","endTime":"17:48","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Which one?","startTime":"17:49","endTime":"17:50","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Let me pull up that, let me pull up that record real quick.","startTime":"17:52","endTime":"17:55","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You're able to define basically when you're able to.","startTime":"17:55","endTime":"17:58","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I don't have the right name of the field, but it basically tells you when you're able to invoice them.","startTime":"17:58","endTime":"18:03","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So you can kind of predetermine with this particular client based on the terms or the contract that you have with them when you're able to invoice them.","startTime":"18:04","endTime":"18:11","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then that can also.","startTime":"18:12","endTime":"18:13","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So that can drive things like the invoice schedule.","startTime":"18:13","endTime":"18:16","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You can say, well, because I know this client doesn't allow me to invoice until it's installed, so let's not tell accounting to invoice until that happens.","startTime":"18:16","endTime":"18:25","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Does that's, this is something that's new for us, but does that sound like something that would be useful to you?","startTime":"18:26","endTime":"18:32","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I think so.","startTime":"18:33","endTime":"18:34","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I mean, we, you know, we, Kip and I and our sales team were just going round and round on that specific item this week that, yeah, one of our biggest clients basically threw up over our invoicing, even though we're right to invoice them, but they have a cash flow problem and they don't want the invoice because they can't pay it, you know, so give us only an invoice for what we can pay.","startTime":"18:34","endTime":"18:55","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I'm like, no, you pay what you can.","startTime":"18:55","endTime":"18:57","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then, like, but went round and round on this merry go round, you know, so they end up influencing us and manipulating our invoicing, you know, that kind of stuff.","startTime":"18:57","endTime":"19:08","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so that's kind of, you know, so I, I, it doesn't sit well with me, clearly, because, you know, that's not the accounting rules I, I like or like to use and enforce.","startTime":"19:08","endTime":"19:19","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But that's why I'm, I am curious again to see the stuff that you have in NetSuite and the framework around it and, you know, the ability to just use it.","startTime":"19:19","endTime":"19:29","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So could you just define that a little bit more, Marcus?","startTime":"19:29","endTime":"19:33","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Because what I'm picturing is it's, I mean, is it a dashboard or what kind of a prompt?","startTime":"19:33","endTime":"19:39","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Like, is it looking at the customer, then their orders, looking at their terms, basing the invoice date on that.","startTime":"19:39","endTime":"19:47","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Those criteria.","startTime":"19:47","endTime":"19:48","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And then how is it prompting the AR person, like, is it a dashboard that they see, like, hey, these are due to be invoiced today?","startTime":"19:48","endTime":"19:54","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"That kind of a thing?","startTime":"19:54","endTime":"19:55","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Exactly.","startTime":"19:55","endTime":"19:56","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It's a dashboard.","startTime":"19:56","endTime":"19:56","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And so this is actually awesome.","startTime":"19:56","endTime":"19:59","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"This is so this feature that we built out, we built it specifically for furniture to solve some of these problems.","startTime":"19:59","endTime":"20:05","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I'm going to see if I can actually.","startTime":"20:05","endTime":"20:06","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"The fields.","startTime":"20:06","endTime":"20:07","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I just posted a screenshot of just.","startTime":"20:07","endTime":"20:08","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"The fields that are filled out on that record into the

yeah.","startTime":"20:16","endTime":"20:17","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"The name of the field was what?","startTime":"20:17","endTime":"20:18","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I think it's.","startTime":"20:18","endTime":"20:19","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I think it's.","startTime":"20:19","endTime":"20:19","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Title transfer is the name of the risk of

you can define that.","startTime":"20:25","endTime":"20:26","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That's if you're.","startTime":"20:26","endTime":"20:27","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That's.","startTime":"20:27","endTime":"20:28","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That's if you have, like, firm contracts and terms with your

ships.","startTime":"20:41","endTime":"20:44","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So it more or less when, you know, the manufacturer bills us.","startTime":"20:44","endTime":"20:47","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"That' queue to build the client.","startTime":"20:47","endTime":"20:50","speaker_name":"Kip

yeah.","startTime":"20:56","endTime":"20:57","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Because the way that.","startTime":"20:57","endTime":"20:58","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"20:58","endTime":"20:59","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So it can be event driven.","startTime":"20:59","endTime":"21:00","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And I'm just trying to pull one up here for a second.","startTime":"21:01","endTime":"21:04","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Just give you a quick.","startTime":"21:04","endTime":"21:05","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I mean, the even more important thing is that because we kind of do that.","startTime":"21:05","endTime":"21:10","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Or when I say we, primarily me, you get in this into a groove and you just start, go, go.","startTime":"21:10","endTime":"21:15","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And it's those exceptions that trip you up.","startTime":"21:16","endTime":"21:18","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Like, you don't.","startTime":"21:18","endTime":"21:18","speaker_name":"Kip

yeah, when you go to set this up and you can assign it to a particular customer, you build your schedule down here.","startTime":"21:45","endTime":"21:53","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Now, these invoice types.","startTime":"21:53","endTime":"21:54","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So we would say here, do you get.","startTime":"21:54","endTime":"21:56","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You guys take a deposit as

50%?","startTime":"22:00","endTime":"22:03","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, 50.","startTime":"22:03","endTime":"22:04","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Even better.","startTime":"22:04","endTime":"22:05","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"22:06","endTime":"22:06","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And the trigger type for that deposit is going to be basically on.","startTime":"22:07","endTime":"22:11","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We'll say, in this case, we're going to say day one of the.","startTime":"22:11","endTime":"22:13","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Of the order because you probably.","startTime":"22:13","endTime":"22:15","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You probably are asking for it right away, right?","startTime":"22:15","endTime":"22:17","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yes.","startTime":"22:17","endTime":"22:18","speaker_name":"Lorraine

Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Yep.","startTime":"22:20","endTime":"22:20","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then it's likely due on receipt as

let's add that line.","startTime":"22:25","endTime":"22:26","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Our next line is going to be the final.","startTime":"22:27","endTime":"22:30","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Let's just say for now it's the final invoice.","startTime":"22:30","endTime":"22:33","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It's going to be 50%.","startTime":"22:33","endTime":"22:34","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then we can say our trigger type is going to be an event.","startTime":"22:35","endTime":"22:38","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That event can be programmed.","startTime":"22:39","endTime":"22:41","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right now we have kip.","startTime":"22:41","endTime":"22:43","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Just so you know, we're using some SQL formulas to identify this.","startTime":"22:44","endTime":"22:48","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So any event that's in the system, we can query for.","startTime":"22:48","endTime":"22:52","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So in your case, what you said is upon shipment.","startTime":"22:52","endTime":"22:55","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But really it's.","startTime":"22:55","endTime":"22:56","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Unless there is something in the system that's saying, okay, this shipped, we would need to know that.","startTime":"22:57","endTime":"23:03","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And if there is, then we'd say, okay, we would create that query and then you would choose it here.","startTime":"23:03","endTime":"23:07","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"For now, let me just create all work orders are complete, just so we can.","startTime":"23:09","endTime":"23:11","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So you can see what happens.","startTime":"23:11","endTime":"23:12","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So then what is happening is this is.","startTime":"23:13","endTime":"23:15","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"This is built into the system and it's associated with the transaction.","startTime":"23:15","endTime":"23:18","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then what happens is it shows up on the dashboard saying it's ready to be invoiced when this event happens.","startTime":"23:19","endTime":"23:28","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And when I say it shows up on an invoice I'm talking about, or shows up on a dashboard, it's going to be in one of these reminders here.","startTime":"23:29","endTime":"23:37","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That's great.","startTime":"23:38","endTime":"23:38","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"You'll have a number that says, I have three invoices to create.","startTime":"23:38","endTime":"23:42","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So are those templates the.","startTime":"23:43","endTime":"23:45","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"I'm assuming you would set up one of those templates per terms that you have.","startTime":"23:45","endTime":"23:52","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Like if you have a client's 50% deposit, 50% on living, I set up those one template for every term that you have and then assign the appropriate template to clients on A1.","startTime":"23:52","endTime":"24:03","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Is that how it works?","startTime":"24:03","endTime":"24:04","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"24:04","endTime":"24:04","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"It's not set up on the client master, it's just a template.","startTime":"24:04","endTime":"24:07","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Then you go and grab it and pull it into the client.","startTime":"24:07","endTime":"24:09","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"24:09","endTime":"24:10","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, exactly.","startTime":"24:10","endTime":"24:11","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So, yeah, that can be shared and then you can modify them for each client too, and so you can have them for specific orders.","startTime":"24:11","endTime":"24:18","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It doesn't have to be.","startTime":"24:18","endTime":"24:19","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That's great.","startTime":"24:19","endTime":"24:19","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"24:20","endTime":"24:20","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So you have some flexibility there as well.","startTime":"24:20","endTime":"24:22","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That's amazing.","startTime":"24:22","endTime":"24:23","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Yeah, that.","startTime":"24:23","endTime":"24:24","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"That will vastly improve our billing process.","startTime":"24:24","endTime":"24:27","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"I'm glad to hear that.","startTime":"24:28","endTime":"24:29","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"All right, so.","startTime":"24:32","endTime":"24:34","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay, so.","startTime":"24:35","endTime":"24:35","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Sorry, I'm just trying to get back on track.","startTime":"24:35","endTime":"24:37","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So we're talking about revenue recognition, cost Recognition.","startTime":"24:37","endTime":"24:39","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"The big thing here is the difference is you really don't need to manage your WIP account for imbalances anymore.","startTime":"24:40","endTime":"24:47","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"In netsuite, the imbalances are going to show up in the accrued purchases account.","startTime":"24:47","endTime":"24:50","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So in that white paper that we gave you, it talks about really the item receipt that's going to impact the WIP account.","startTime":"24:51","endTime":"25:01","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then it's when the product is recognized as a cost, and that is when it's fulfilled or leaves your warehouse, that's when the cost is recognized.","startTime":"25:02","endTime":"25:10","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And so, and then we do some things in addition there to make sure that if there's some timing issues, you can, the system will prompt you to generate some journal entries to accrue revenue or cost to make sure that you're meeting that gap requirement of timing.","startTime":"25:11","endTime":"25:28","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So I don't know how deep you're able to go into that.","startTime":"25:30","endTime":"25:34","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Lorraine, if you have any other questions about that, but that's usually one of the deeper questions that we have from dealers coming off core, because it is different.","startTime":"25:35","endTime":"25:46","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Because I think, guys, it hits whip when the vendor bill comes in.","startTime":"25:46","endTime":"25:50","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Or.","startTime":"25:53","endTime":"25:53","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The vendor invoice, if I'm correct.","startTime":"25:53","endTime":"25:55","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, inherently it makes sense to me.","startTime":"25:57","endTime":"25:59","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Obviously, it's just a matter of, you know, changing now how we analyze WIP and how we're cleaning that up and making sure we're leaving that when we invoice.","startTime":"25:59","endTime":"26:10","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But now you're saying it's going to be through the accrued purchases account.","startTime":"26:10","endTime":"26:13","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I think we have the same work, it's just in a different account.","startTime":"26:14","endTime":"26:18","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then the other thing that we did is we built a utility called Cost Variance and Recognition Utility.","startTime":"26:21","endTime":"26:28","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And so what that does is it searches the system and really the accrued purchases account to see if there are any imbalances.","startTime":"26:28","endTime":"26:35","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So a good example of an imbalance would be, all right, my purchase order, I ordered an item on my PO for $100.","startTime":"26:36","endTime":"26:43","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"When I generated my item receipt, it inherited that cost from the PO.","startTime":"26:44","endTime":"26:48","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So the item receipt came in at $100.","startTime":"26:48","endTime":"26:50","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then when I got my vendor bill, the vendor bill came in at 150.","startTime":"26:50","endTime":"26:54","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"There was a $50 difference.","startTime":"26:54","endTime":"26:55","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So I created an issue record because I wanted to find out, well, hey, we got a price discrepancy.","startTime":"26:56","endTime":"26:59","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I got to figure this out.","startTime":"26:59","endTime":"27:00","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And we did our investigation and we found out, yeah, actually it does cost $150.","startTime":"27:00","endTime":"27:05","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Now, I know that's somewhat rare, but this is the kind of scenario I'm talking about.","startTime":"27:06","endTime":"27:09","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But the item receipt impacted the accrued purchases at only $100.","startTime":"27:12","endTime":"27:17","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So we generate the, you know, the vendor bill.","startTime":"27:17","endTime":"27:20","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We have an imbalance of $50.","startTime":"27:20","endTime":"27:21","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So our tool finds all of those imbalances and will automatically create the journal entry to recognize cost.","startTime":"27:21","endTime":"27:29","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And you want, you're going to want to run that at the end of the month, so it's happening in the same period.","startTime":"27:30","endTime":"27:34","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And it'll post those vendor variances via journal entry to recognize costs and it tags the project.","startTime":"27:35","endTime":"27:40","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And actually I wrote that down that we have to write off any variances, any variance balance at the end of the month.","startTime":"27:41","endTime":"27:46","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So is that going to be automatically done or.","startTime":"27:46","endTime":"27:49","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We have to do it.","startTime":"27:49","endTime":"27:50","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You have to do it.","startTime":"27:50","endTime":"27:51","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"27:51","endTime":"27:52","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"27:52","endTime":"27:52","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It'll be kind of one of your end of the month tasks.","startTime":"27:52","endTime":"27:55","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It is something that we can automate.","startTime":"27:55","endTime":"27:57","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We're a little nervous about automating.","startTime":"27:57","endTime":"27:58","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"No, no.","startTime":"27:58","endTime":"27:59","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And that's okay.","startTime":"27:59","endTime":"27:59","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I just, I didn't.","startTime":"27:59","endTime":"28:00","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I hadn't clarified my own note, so I wanted to clarify that.","startTime":"28:00","endTime":"28:03","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I do.","startTime":"28:03","endTime":"28:04","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I did want to ask.","startTime":"28:05","endTime":"28:06","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So, Marcus.","startTime":"28:06","endTime":"28:07","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Because there are other implications to that too.","startTime":"28:07","endTime":"28:10","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"If you have a $50 variance, that affects the GP on the order and that affects commissions.","startTime":"28:10","endTime":"28:15","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So does that flow through back to the order so that the true GDP is reflected on the order and we can calculate.","startTime":"28:15","endTime":"28:20","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"It does.","startTime":"28:20","endTime":"28:21","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"28:21","endTime":"28:21","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"28:21","endTime":"28:22","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Now commissions and commissionable GP are calculated at the project level, not the order level, but.","startTime":"28:22","endTime":"28:27","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"28:27","endTime":"28:28","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"It does.","startTime":"28:28","endTime":"28:28","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yes.","startTime":"28:28","endTime":"28:29","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"It affects the commissional gb.","startTime":"28:29","endTime":"28:30","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yep.","startTime":"28:31","endTime":"28:31","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So.","startTime":"28:31","endTime":"28:31","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And we have a internal rule that any cost variance is what, over fifteen hundred dollars must be approved by Matt.","startTime":"28:31","endTime":"28:40","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So, so this, that kind of variances, if it's not automatic, which it sounds like the tool is, but we need to then be able to go through and look at them and make sure that Matt is able to see them and approve them and figure out what they are.","startTime":"28:40","endTime":"28:54","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"28:55","endTime":"28:55","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And that's where the issue record comes in.","startTime":"28:55","endTime":"28:57","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So you can set your.","startTime":"28:57","endTime":"28:59","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It sounds like you have a pretty high tolerance, but.","startTime":"28:59","endTime":"29:02","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"29:03","endTime":"29:04","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So that can be set to anything you want.","startTime":"29:04","endTime":"29:05","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And really your people will just create an issue for any of those.","startTime":"29:05","endTime":"29:08","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And those issues over a certain amount could automatically show up on Matt's dashboard for him to.","startTime":"29:08","endTime":"29:13","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But we'll have to think about if he actually wants that until it's.","startTime":"29:15","endTime":"29:18","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Because typically those issues get investigated.","startTime":"29:18","endTime":"29:21","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I don't know if you want Matt investigating those or once they're investigated and there's no.","startTime":"29:22","endTime":"29:27","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Matt is told the whole sob story and then he has to disapprove it.","startTime":"29:27","endTime":"29:31","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But that's part of the discipline, is that you have to go present to him why there's a variance?","startTime":"29:31","endTime":"29:36","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Largely.","startTime":"29:40","endTime":"29:40","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, it's largely an honor system now.","startTime":"29:40","endTime":"29:43","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"You're depending on people to tell us and sometimes, you know, you're assuming it's happening.","startTime":"29:45","endTime":"29:49","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"But it would be nice to have better guardrails in place to make sure it's happening.","startTime":"29:49","endTime":"29:53","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"That'll be your issue record.","startTime":"29:53","endTime":"29:54","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You'll be able to do that.","startTime":"29:54","endTime":"29:56","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay, we can move on.","startTime":"29:58","endTime":"30:00","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"The next topic is chart of accounts.","startTime":"30:00","endTime":"30:02","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I do just want to say for revenue and cost recognition, this does not have to be our last conversation.","startTime":"30:02","endTime":"30:06","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like I said, this is.","startTime":"30:06","endTime":"30:07","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"This is typically for dealers coming off core.","startTime":"30:07","endTime":"30:10","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"There's usually a lot of questions around this.","startTime":"30:10","endTime":"30:12","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So don't hesitate.","startTime":"30:12","endTime":"30:14","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We expect more and we'll be happy to do some more explaining as well.","startTime":"30:14","endTime":"30:19","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"The one thing I would say about this though is your WIP account, which I know your bank looks at and I think you can borrow against, that's probably going to be impacted earlier in the process than what it is now because it's going to be.","startTime":"30:20","endTime":"30:34","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"The item receipt is going to be incrementing that account.","startTime":"30:34","endTime":"30:38","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, no bank doesn't look at our WIP anymore.","startTime":"30:38","endTime":"30:41","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They, they actually just look at our backlog.","startTime":"30:41","endTime":"30:43","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we change that metric.","startTime":"30:43","endTime":"30:45","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So WIP is no longer on the table.","startTime":"30:45","endTime":"30:48","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So that's very interesting.","startTime":"30:48","endTime":"30:49","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So for the sake of the transcript, so we.","startTime":"30:49","endTime":"30:51","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That's definitely a key finding associated with KBM is that WIP is not as important as the backlog.","startTime":"30:51","endTime":"30:57","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So we need a lot of clarity on the backlog.","startTime":"30:57","endTime":"30:59","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So with that in mind, before we jump into the next topic, let me ask you a couple questions about your backlog.","startTime":"30:59","endTime":"31:05","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Some dealers define it differently.","startTime":"31:07","endTime":"31:09","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Let me throw out a definition.","startTime":"31:10","endTime":"31:13","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You tell me, yay or nay.","startTime":"31:13","endTime":"31:14","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Backlog is everything on a sales order that is not yet invoiced.","startTime":"31:15","endTime":"31:19","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Is that your definition?","startTime":"31:21","endTime":"31:22","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"31:23","endTime":"31:23","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yes.","startTime":"31:24","endTime":"31:24","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"31:26","endTime":"31:26","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Quotes don't.","startTime":"31:26","endTime":"31:27","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Quotes do not impact backlog.","startTime":"31:27","endTime":"31:30","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Those are potential backlog, but they aren't backlog.","startTime":"31:30","endTime":"31:33","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Don't hit backlog until they've been converted to an open order or whatever Orion calls it.","startTime":"31:33","endTime":"31:38","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"We call them an order.","startTime":"31:38","endTime":"31:39","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Yep.","startTime":"31:39","endTime":"31:40","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But yes, we have the same definition.","startTime":"31:40","endTime":"31:42","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Would it also be valuable for you to see a backlog by vendor?","startTime":"31:43","endTime":"31:48","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Sure.","startTime":"31:49","endTime":"31:50","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"31:50","endTime":"31:51","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's hard to get right now.","startTime":"31:51","endTime":"31:53","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, that'd be great.","startTime":"31:53","endTime":"31:53","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So another dealer wanted to see backlog just for items that are on purchase orders.","startTime":"31:54","endTime":"32:00","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We don't analyze it per se too much, again because of the lack of visibility to it.","startTime":"32:03","endTime":"32:09","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But obviously we're just looking at it in totality and looking what's coming down the pipe, you know, the pipeline.","startTime":"32:09","endTime":"32:14","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And that's what we're looking at.","startTime":"32:14","endTime":"32:16","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I use it to do my forecasting, you know, like what month and what I'm going to bill and things like that for it.","startTime":"32:16","endTime":"32:22","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So.","startTime":"32:23","endTime":"32:24","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But the granular level of what's in the backlog, we don't do too much.","startTime":"32:25","endTime":"32:30","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Kevin does a little bit more because he's drilling down and he's pulling out the margin of those projects so that again from my forecast I can pull that in and I share that with Matt and Mark so that they also know what's coming and what it looks like.","startTime":"32:31","endTime":"32:46","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, there's another varieties.","startTime":"32:46","endTime":"32:48","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"There's a revenue or backlog by revenue, backlog by gp, backlog by cost, backlog vendor.","startTime":"32:48","endTime":"32:54","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Wow.","startTime":"32:55","endTime":"32:55","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So what we've done and sorry to interrupt you, but what we've done is we created a backlog dashboard.","startTime":"32:56","endTime":"33:01","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"33:01","endTime":"33:02","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And, and basically we just packed this dashboard with whatever variety of backlog variation of backlog reports that you need to see.","startTime":"33:02","endTime":"33:08","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So hopefully you can just and see every variety of backlog report that you need.","startTime":"33:08","endTime":"33:13","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"33:13","endTime":"33:14","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Nice.","startTime":"33:14","endTime":"33:15","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Because yeah, I do remember we've been asked in the past like, I don't know why they can't pull this information their side, but they can't or don't want to.","startTime":"33:15","endTime":"33:23","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"I don't know.","startTime":"33:23","endTime":"33:23","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"No, we'll say, you know, what's in the forecast, what's coming.","startTime":"33:24","endTime":"33:26","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And we're like, so we.","startTime":"33:26","endTime":"33:28","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Yeah, I mean that's essentially a vendor specific backlog.","startTime":"33:28","endTime":"33:31","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Okay, great.","startTime":"33:33","endTime":"33:34","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So part of our, part of the realize phase, which is the next phase after discovery, is configuration.","startTime":"33:34","endTime":"33:39","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Who should we work with to configure those that backlog dashboard that be kipping?","startTime":"33:40","endTime":"33:46","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Probably me.","startTime":"33:46","endTime":"33:47","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"33:47","endTime":"33:47","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"33:47","endTime":"33:48","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Okay, great.","startTime":"33:48","endTime":"33:49","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We also have one for booking and one for billing.","startTime":"33:49","endTime":"33:52","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Again, it's just a dashboard with that same booking or billing report but with a different variation of it.","startTime":"33:53","endTime":"34:00","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So you can kind of go one place and get everything that you need.","startTime":"34:00","endTime":"34:02","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So we'll be handling that during the configuration phase.","startTime":"34:02","endTime":"34:06","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"These dashboards, I know the answer already, but just to confirm, we can change them after the fact if we get six months down the road.","startTime":"34:07","endTime":"34:16","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Like, no, this is not what we wanted.","startTime":"34:16","endTime":"34:18","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Okay, great starting point.","startTime":"34:18","endTime":"34:21","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And we'll train you how to do all of that.","startTime":"34:21","endTime":"34:23","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We expect you to do that.","startTime":"34:24","endTime":"34:26","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"All right, Chart of accounts, I believe, correct me if I'm wrong, I believe we delivered to you the base chart of accounts.","startTime":"34:27","endTime":"34:34","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yes.","startTime":"34:35","endTime":"34:35","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"When we're on site, did you get a chance to review that?","startTime":"34:36","endTime":"34:38","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Not only did we review it, we've.","startTime":"34:38","endTime":"34:40","speaker_name":"Chris","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Already mapped our accounts to it.","startTime":"34:40","endTime":"34:42","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Wow, good for you.","startTime":"34:44","endTime":"34:46","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"I know

drive.","startTime":"39:50","endTime":"39:56","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And the reason why I was asking about when you pay was really more about what's the trigger in the project for you to pay out commissions.","startTime":"39:58","endTime":"40:05","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It sounds like it's when the customer pays.","startTime":"40:05","endTime":"40:07","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"All right, yes.","startTime":"40:07","endTime":"40:08","speaker_name":"Kip

gp.","startTime":"40:08","endTime":"40:18","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But then there's all the other nonsense that happens later on in the project.","startTime":"40:18","endTime":"40:21","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Do you have any type of method to true.","startTime":"40:21","endTime":"40:23","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"To do a true up?","startTime":"40:23","endTime":"40:24","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yes, we do a clawback and then it would hit the subsequent months report as a negative and it would deduct, you know that from their.","startTime":"40:25","endTime":"40:33","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"The commission in that following month.","startTime":"40:33","endTime":"40:35","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And forgive me for asking this, but my notes don't have it.","startTime":"40:36","endTime":"40:39","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Remind me what system you're using for calculating commissions and tracking all that.","startTime":"40:39","endTime":"40:43","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Core and Excel.","startTime":"40:44","endTime":"40:45","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Core does a horrendous job of it.","startTime":"40:46","endTime":"40:49","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So yeah, we end up dumping to Excel and doing it's not ideal.","startTime":"40:49","endTime":"40:54","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Yeah, well, I'm hoping that ours is better.","startTime":"40:54","endTime":"40:57","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It can't be worse.","startTime":"40:58","endTime":"40:59","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So there's a low bar.","startTime":"41:02","endTime":"41:03","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"41:04","endTime":"41:04","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So the clawbacks are interesting to me.","startTime":"41:05","endTime":"41:06","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Are you doing the clawbacks via Core or is that all in Excel?","startTime":"41:06","endTime":"41:09","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yes, yeah, Core, the report.","startTime":"41:09","endTime":"41:12","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"The report runs and picks up all the activity again, it's the same report over and over again.","startTime":"41:12","endTime":"41:18","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So each person's projects and orders, you know, sum up and you get all the pluses and minus.","startTime":"41:18","endTime":"41:23","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And if there is a historical thing that came through, it would give us a negative and that would go against the current payout for the month.","startTime":"41:23","endTime":"41:30","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Got it.","startTime":"41:30","endTime":"41:30","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"41:30","endTime":"41:31","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Assuming there's a payout and if there isn't, then obviously that's where we have a little bit of risk that we're carrying a negative because we overpaid somebody at some couple months earlier and then, you know, something came up.","startTime":"41:31","endTime":"41:42","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So.","startTime":"41:42","endTime":"41:42","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, do you.","startTime":"41:43","endTime":"41:44","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay, so you have, you will have some opportunity and when we go into the configuration to and set this up, you'll see a little bit more clearly.","startTime":"41:44","endTime":"41:51","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But you do have some opportunity to change if you want to how you're doing that.","startTime":"41:51","endTime":"41:56","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like we do allow for multiple scheduled commission calculations, including One after.","startTime":"41:56","endTime":"42:05","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Well, actually, you can kind of like the invoice scheduling.","startTime":"42:05","endTime":"42:08","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Remember how I showed you the event and you can create query, define the timing.","startTime":"42:08","endTime":"42:11","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You could do the same thing with commissions.","startTime":"42:11","endTime":"42:13","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So you could say, all right, well, I want to pay a certain amount upon deposit, and then I want to pay a certain amount upon payment from the client.","startTime":"42:13","endTime":"42:22","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then I want to do another recalculation once the projects closed and all punches completed and all the vendor bills are paid.","startTime":"42:22","endTime":"42:30","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So, yes, that's nice.","startTime":"42:30","endTime":"42:34","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I don't want.","startTime":"42:34","endTime":"42:35","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I personally don't want to do that because then again, it'll just be more money up for the front, and then we'd be to claw it back at the end, you know, type stuff.","startTime":"42:35","endTime":"42:42","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we'll keep it simple.","startTime":"42:42","endTime":"42:43","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"42:44","endTime":"42:44","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That being said, though, obviously, you know, I need to make sure we run this by Matt, that he's on board with it.","startTime":"42:45","endTime":"42:51","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I do have a question.","startTime":"42:52","endTime":"42:53","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Is everything we've been talking about and saying about our commission structure, is that best practices?","startTime":"42:53","endTime":"42:58","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Is that what you've been seeing with other dealers?","startTime":"42:58","endTime":"43:00","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's similar, a little bit different.","startTime":"43:00","endTime":"43:02","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"43:02","endTime":"43:03","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"43:03","endTime":"43:04","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I mean, yours is a little bit more simplified.","startTime":"43:04","endTime":"43:05","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"One of the reasons why we built ours with those schedules is because people are doing it all over the place.","startTime":"43:05","endTime":"43:09","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"43:09","endTime":"43:10","speaker_name":"Lorraine

Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And that's.","startTime":"43:40","endTime":"43:40","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's been a struggle because their plans are so convoluted and our core system reporting cannot support the plan that they designed for these people.","startTime":"43:40","endTime":"43:52","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, yeah.","startTime":"43:52","endTime":"43:53","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We've historically had a plan or a problem where plans would get designed and signed off on by sales staff, and then they'd bring it back to core and it'd be like, well, core doesn't.","startTime":"43:53","endTime":"44:05","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Can't do that.","startTime":"44:05","endTime":"44:05","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So what we'd find out kind of after something

that's.","startTime":"44:11","endTime":"44:12","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So are you guys doing splits?","startTime":"44:12","endTime":"44:15","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So you are sharing based on, like a contribution

we support that as well.","startTime":"44:28","endTime":"44:29","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I just wanted to know where it gets a little bit challenging is if you

that.","startTime":"44:37","endTime":"44:37","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That gets really challenging.","startTime":"44:37","endTime":"44:39","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"No, usually it's been splits on the same type of plan within the

close.","startTime":"45:15","endTime":"45:17","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And as I mentioned, as you go into period close, we have some documentation for you.","startTime":"45:17","endTime":"45:22","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So we.","startTime":"45:22","endTime":"45:23","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We have some PDF documents on some of these topics and some videos on some of these topics.","startTime":"45:24","endTime":"45:28","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Before.","startTime":"45:28","endTime":"45:29","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Before we get there, I have something, another question.","startTime":"45:29","endTime":"45:31","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We've talked about commissions, but another big thing we do is we have a variable comp program that is paid out quarterly.","startTime":"45:31","endTime":"45:40","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And again, it's all done on Excel, 100% on Excel.","startTime":"45:41","endTime":"45:46","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so I don't know if that's something that can be done in the same system, if we can track it, and I don't even know if that's feasible at all.","startTime":"45:47","endTime":"45:54","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Possibly.","startTime":"45:56","endTime":"45:56","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Talk to me about the variable comp.","startTime":"45:56","endTime":"45:58","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Is it based on, like, goals, revenue goals or opportunity goals?","startTime":"45:58","endTime":"46:02","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Mostly it's margin goals, the company margin.","startTime":"46:02","endTime":"46:05","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And again, every quarter we.","startTime":"46:05","endTime":"46:08","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We get a certain threshold and, you know, it's creating a pool, and then that pool gets paid out to the individuals based on their agreement and how much they're supposedly getting.","startTime":"46:08","endTime":"46:20","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So this one's actually pretty straightforward on the math calculation.","startTime":"46:22","endTime":"46:26","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"46:27","endTime":"46:27","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But again, it's all Excel, so that's the only thing that's, you know, sounds.","startTime":"46:28","endTime":"46:33","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like it might be a good phase two project.","startTime":"46:33","endTime":"46:35","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay, no, that's good.","startTime":"46:35","endTime":"46:37","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"No, and that's exactly why I wanted.","startTime":"46:37","endTime":"46:38","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"To bring it up.","startTime":"46:38","endTime":"46:39","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"46:39","endTime":"46:39","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"No, that's good.","startTime":"46:39","endTime":"46:40","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"46:40","endTime":"46:40","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"No, and it's good, too.","startTime":"46:40","endTime":"46:42","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So for the sake of the transcript, it's called variable compensation program.","startTime":"46:42","endTime":"46:45","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It sounds like all employees participate.","startTime":"46:46","endTime":"46:47","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"No, still select, few are rewarded and incentive.","startTime":"46:48","endTime":"46:54","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Mostly our sales.","startTime":"46:54","endTime":"46:55","speaker_name":"Lorraine

gp.","startTime":"46:55","endTime":"46:59","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Correct.","startTime":"46:59","endTime":"46:59","speaker_name":"Lorraine

good.","startTime":"47:00","endTime":"47:01","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So we'll just.","startTime":"47:01","endTime":"47:02","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We'll notate that and mark that down as a phase two item.","startTime":"47:02","endTime":"47:05","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay, thank you.","startTime":"47:05","endTime":"47:06","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We're going to refer to a lot of links, netsuite documents, videos, things like that.","startTime":"47:06","endTime":"47:11","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I just sent all of that over, like, in an easy Word

guys.","startTime":"47:15","endTime":"47:16","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So if you want to reference all that stuff later, you can.","startTime":"47:16","endTime":"47:18","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Thank you.","startTime":"47:19","endTime":"47:19","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yep.","startTime":"47:20","endTime":"47:20","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"47:20","endTime":"47:21","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So the next one period close.","startTime":"47:21","endTime":"47:22","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We do, we did provide a PDF and a link to some help docs and a video on period close.","startTime":"47:23","endTime":"47:30","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Netsuite has its own period close checklist and it's kind of a, you know, step by step process to close the period.","startTime":"47:31","endTime":"47:38","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I have most furniture dealers augment that with some of their own additional steps that NetSuite doesn't have.","startTime":"47:40","endTime":"47:46","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So there's still be a few things you're going to need to do outside of this.","startTime":"47:46","endTime":"47:50","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But a couple things to know here is you once it's.","startTime":"47:50","endTime":"47:55","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Once it's locked, nobody can make any edits.","startTime":"47:55","endTime":"47:57","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Except you can allow for non GL edits when you lock I and clarify.","startTime":"47:58","endTime":"48:07","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We'Re locking the period, we're locking the account.","startTime":"48:07","endTime":"48:09","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We're locking what the period.","startTime":"48:09","endTime":"48:11","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So, so any transaction that has a GL impact would be locked, not editable.","startTime":"48:11","endTime":"48:16","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Is it possible to reopen the period.","startTime":"48:18","endTime":"48:20","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"At a later time?","startTime":"48:20","endTime":"48:21","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yep, you sure can.","startTime":"48:21","endTime":"48:23","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And if you're really good at closing your accounting period like you're closing like less than 10 days, you will likely have people coming into your office asking you to open the period to do something.","startTime":"48:24","endTime":"48:34","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So with that and I'm going to say this, and Debbie, I'd like you to give your opinion too.","startTime":"48:35","endTime":"48:38","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, like in my companies when were doing this, I would allow for non GL edits because more what would happen all the time is somebody would come in and say hey, I need to put a note on this transaction and because it's in a closed period but like you know, we haven't even delivered it yet so I need to put a note on it.","startTime":"48:38","endTime":"48:55","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I don't want people coming to ask me to open a whole accounting period so they can put a note on a transaction.","startTime":"48:56","endTime":"49:00","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So I allow for non GL edits.","startTime":"49:00","endTime":"49:02","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But Debbie, what are your thoughts on that?","startTime":"49:02","endTime":"49:04","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I would agree with that.","startTime":"49:04","endTime":"49:06","speaker_name":"Chris","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"One point to consider is that when you close the period, you can actually close the quote subledgers first.","startTime":"49:06","endTime":"49:14","speaker_name":"Chris","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"So you can close AP ar then gm.","startTime":"49:15","endTime":"49:18","speaker_name":"Chris","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"The ability to post a non GL impacting note like Marcus was describing, you can limit that to selected people as well.","startTime":"49:19","endTime":"49:30","speaker_name":"Chris","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"So what's interesting about that is we literally just kind of had this.","startTime":"49:31","endTime":"49:34","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We haven't even finished our conversation.","startTime":"49:34","endTime":"49:36","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Kip brought it up that we haven't even been doing this hard close in core for ourselves.","startTime":"49:37","endTime":"49:42","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Every month we close the sub ledgers.","startTime":"49:42","endTime":"49:44","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Every month we the apar and Then the gl.","startTime":"49:44","endTime":"49:47","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But we've never actually hard closed the year to not allow anything to happen.","startTime":"49:47","endTime":"49:51","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we're going to talk about it more on Monday so that, so this happens automatically in NET suites when we close.","startTime":"49:52","endTime":"49:58","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You actually will go into the checklist and do it.","startTime":"49:58","endTime":"50:02","speaker_name":"Chris","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Yeah, yeah.","startTime":"50:03","endTime":"50:04","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"50:04","endTime":"50:05","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But again I would have the authority to go in and open the period, tell them to go post something, do something like that.","startTime":"50:06","endTime":"50:12","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"If.","startTime":"50:12","endTime":"50:13","speaker_name":"Chris","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"And the way it was described to me because I just spoke to the CORE people about this quote unquote hard closing of periods is.","startTime":"50:16","endTime":"50:23","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"That's in addition to closing the sub ledgers, you hard close the entire period in its totality.","startTime":"50:23","endTime":"50:29","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"They said that the reason that you do that is that it creates a snapshot in time so that when you referred, when you go back and run financials or something, it just looks at that snapshot.","startTime":"50:29","endTime":"50:40","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"It doesn't have to go back and recompile all of the data, which is a massive resource hog.","startTime":"50:40","endTime":"50:46","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So that I get.","startTime":"50:46","endTime":"50:48","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And so I don't know if Orion's like that too.","startTime":"50:48","endTime":"50:51","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Yeah, I mean, I understand like for us doing a hard close on December that makes a lot of sense.","startTime":"50:52","endTime":"50:58","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Obviously when we're done with the year, we're, you know, finished our review, all that hard close that we're done.","startTime":"50:58","endTime":"51:02","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But I'm not 100 clear on what's the value of closing period 2 or 3 or 4 when they're still, you know, we're in the period I'm in the year.","startTime":"51:03","endTime":"51:11","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The danger with that would be to post transactions in the wrong period.","startTime":"51:12","endTime":"51:18","speaker_name":"Chris","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"An AP associate goes in and puts in an invoice that you got this month, but they put it into, you know, into a period two months.","startTime":"51:20","endTime":"51:30","speaker_name":"Chris","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Ago and it happens and actually I've seen.","startTime":"51:30","endTime":"51:35","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It's one of the reasons I, I get that.","startTime":"51:35","endTime":"51:36","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But I thought again, by clarity, closing our sub ledgers, by closing our GL allows that not to happen.","startTime":"51:36","endTime":"51:42","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I guess.","startTime":"51:42","endTime":"51:43","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Correct.","startTime":"51:43","endTime":"51:44","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"In core.","startTime":"51:44","endTime":"51:44","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"In Core, but we soft close, they.","startTime":"51:45","endTime":"51:47","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Are not able to post anything to prior periods.","startTime":"51:47","endTime":"51:49","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, yeah.","startTime":"51:49","endTime":"51:50","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I don't know actually like this concept of soft close, hard close.","startTime":"51:50","endTime":"51:53","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I don't think netsuite necessarily has that right, Debbie.","startTime":"51:53","endTime":"51:56","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It's kind of like you close the period.","startTime":"51:56","endTime":"51:59","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I think CORE is doing that because of some database optimization that they're able to do.","startTime":"51:59","endTime":"52:04","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Correct.","startTime":"52:04","endTime":"52:04","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Yeah, I think that's.","startTime":"52:04","endTime":"52:05","speaker_name":"Kip

Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"52:06","endTime":"52:06","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"It's not as well designed.","startTime":"52:06","endTime":"52:07","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Well, I have no issue.","startTime":"52:09","endTime":"52:09","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Again, I, I think again it's appropriate.","startTime":"52:09","endTime":"52:11","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's a proper.","startTime":"52:11","endTime":"52:12","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We can totally do it.","startTime":"52:12","endTime":"52:14","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Not an issue and if I need to open it, I open it.","startTime":"52:14","endTime":"52:17","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I'm sorry.","startTime":"52:17","endTime":"52:18","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"52:19","endTime":"52:19","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But I like the idea of that notes idea.","startTime":"52:19","endTime":"52:21","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"I think that's clever.","startTime":"52:22","endTime":"52:23","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Yeah, yeah.","startTime":"52:23","endTime":"52:25","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Certainly would save you a lot of

extra days to challenge and correct before you have to present your financials.","startTime":"53:10","endTime":"53:23","speaker_name":"Gary Strickland","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"So five is always kind of the gold standard, I guess.","startTime":"53:23","endTime":"53:26","speaker_name":"Gary Strickland","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"And I mean to be real, my team actually we try to finalize

minutes.","startTime":"54:32","endTime":"54:33","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I think we could do this one because we've already kind of talked about this one.","startTime":"54:33","endTime":"54:35","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So bill payment and cash management.","startTime":"54:35","endTime":"54:37","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Let me ask you a couple quick questions here.","startTime":"54:38","endTime":"54:40","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We, we talked about in our on site session about the ability to have an approval process on vendor bills or vendor invoices.","startTime":"54:40","endTime":"54:50","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That approval.","startTime":"54:50","endTime":"54:51","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"There's two different ways to do this.","startTime":"54:51","endTime":"54:53","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You can, you can use the NetSuite native approval process and if you enter a bill into the system and it's pending approval, it has no GL impact.","startTime":"54:53","endTime":"55:02","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So it doesn't show up on your AP aging from a cash flow forecast.","startTime":"55:03","endTime":"55:08","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It's not considered all of that.","startTime":"55:08","endTime":"55:10","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Or you can enter it and put it on payment hold.","startTime":"55:10","endTime":"55:14","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And it does have a GL impact, but it won't allow anybody to pay it.","startTime":"55:14","endTime":"55:17","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So there's really kind of two ways that you can do this.","startTime":"55:18","endTime":"55:20","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And the reason why you would maybe not bring it in as an approved state is there might be a discrepancy.","startTime":"55:20","endTime":"55:25","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But the idea here is if somebody's processing payroll or payroll bills, they say there's a discrepancy.","startTime":"55:25","endTime":"55:32","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I'll put it in.","startTime":"55:32","endTime":"55:33","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I'll either say it's pending approval, no GL impact, or we don't even have the approval process turned on.","startTime":"55:33","endTime":"55:39","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We say it's on payment hold, has an AP impact.","startTime":"55:39","endTime":"55:42","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Did we talked a little bit about that?","startTime":"55:43","endTime":"55:44","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Did you, did we decide on what would be ideal?","startTime":"55:44","endTime":"55:47","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Do you have a, do you lean in a direction there?","startTime":"55:47","endTime":"55:49","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like what we do now is it's literally in limbo and not in any system.","startTime":"55:54","endTime":"56:00","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"56:00","endTime":"56:01","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Until it gets resolved and reconciled and then it gets posted, you know, so, so definitely want to improve on that.","startTime":"56:02","endTime":"56:10","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I do like to get the pending and so talk to me a little bit more about this payment hold.","startTime":"56:10","endTime":"56:16","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Where would it actually post in my liabilities then?","startTime":"56:16","endTime":"56:19","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Would I see it?","startTime":"56:19","endTime":"56:20","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yep, yep.","startTime":"56:20","endTime":"56:21","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So it posts.","startTime":"56:21","endTime":"56:22","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It's going to impact your financial statements.","startTime":"56:23","endTime":"56:25","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It just won't allow anybody to pay it until that has been resolved.","startTime":"56:25","endTime":"56:28","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So I'll kind of give you my perspective.","startTime":"56:28","endTime":"56:30","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"56:30","endTime":"56:30","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I do want to defer here to Gary and Debbie as well, but in my companies I preferred getting it into the system because then I want to know if there's a discrepancy.","startTime":"56:30","endTime":"56:42","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But I want it in the system.","startTime":"56:42","endTime":"56:43","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I want my financials to reflect that information because even if there is a discrepancy, it's usually minor.","startTime":"56:43","endTime":"56:49","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It's not going to swing my like even a whole percent.","startTime":"56:49","endTime":"56:51","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"56:52","endTime":"56:53","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So I prefer the payment hold over the hard pending approval or approval.","startTime":"56:53","endTime":"56:57","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But Debbie and Gary, what are your, what's your opinions on that?","startTime":"56:57","endTime":"57:00","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Did we lose them?","startTime":"57:04","endTime":"57:05","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"No.","startTime":"57:05","endTime":"57:06","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Oh, you said you actually prefer the payment hold.","startTime":"57:07","endTime":"57:10","speaker_name":"Chris","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"I do, yeah.","startTime":"57:11","endTime":"57:11","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Instead of.","startTime":"57:11","endTime":"57:12","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, I like the showing the impact when you're getting it.","startTime":"57:13","endTime":"57:20","speaker_name":"Chris","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"You would need to have a Safe search or something to make sure that somebody is removing the hold on a timely basis.","startTime":"57:21","endTime":"57:29","speaker_name":"Chris","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"And basically what would happen is it's being going into this liability called payment hold.","startTime":"57:31","endTime":"57:36","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then once it's clear discrepancy reconciled, it then goes into AP trade.","startTime":"57:36","endTime":"57:41","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"No, that's a good question, though.","startTime":"57:42","endTime":"57:43","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It does not, it does not have a stopover in another account.","startTime":"57:43","endTime":"57:47","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It's going to have.","startTime":"57:47","endTime":"57:48","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It's going to have the normal GL impact that it would even if it wasn't on hold.","startTime":"57:48","endTime":"57:52","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I will hit AP and expense ready.","startTime":"57:54","endTime":"57:56","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"When you have it on hold.","startTime":"57:56","endTime":"57:58","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay, that's.","startTime":"57:58","endTime":"57:59","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I mean, that's good.","startTime":"57:59","endTime":"58:00","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yes.","startTime":"58:00","endTime":"58:00","speaker_name":"Lorraine

more accurate your cash flows.","startTime":"58:04","endTime":"58:06","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Your cash flow is going to be a lot more accurate

you.","startTime":"58:08","endTime":"58:08","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"If.","startTime":"58:09","endTime":"58:09","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, like Marcus said, the variances tend to be small.","startTime":"58:10","endTime":"58:14","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So it's not.","startTime":"58:14","endTime":"58:15","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"It, it's not.","startTime":"58:15","endTime":"58:16","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"It's almost immaterial.","startTime":"58:17","endTime":"58:18","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"But in terms of the effect impact on cash flow.","startTime":"58:18","endTime":"58:21","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Yeah, yeah, I'm consistent with Marcus's.","startTime":"58:22","endTime":"58:24","speaker_name":"Gary Strickland","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"Let's get it in the system.","startTime":"58:24","endTime":"58:25","speaker_name":"Gary

can.","startTime":"58:32","endTime":"58:34","speaker_name":"Gary Strickland","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"And we can work with it.","startTime":"58:34","endTime":"58:35","speaker_name":"Gary

that.","startTime":"58:40","endTime":"58:41","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Payment hole will plan for that.","startTime":"58:41","endTime":"58:42","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then Debbie, just so you know, you mentioned like having a safe search, and so that's a good point.","startTime":"58:42","endTime":"58:47","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We have.","startTime":"58:47","endTime":"58:47","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So we use the issue record to track those variances and then those issue records shows up on people's dashboard to get resolved.","startTime":"58:47","endTime":"58:54","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And we could have another safe search for like maybe the AP
