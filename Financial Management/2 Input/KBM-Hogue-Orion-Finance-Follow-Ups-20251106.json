Costco stuff brought in and they had dinner.","startTime":"04:01","endTime":"04:07","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Some of our old co workers stopped by because they were in the old area, that area for.","startTime":"04:08","endTime":"04:13","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"They stopped by for dinner and our one developer started coding at 7am and did not like, get up from his chair until 9pm like he was a machine.","startTime":"04:13","endTime":"04:26","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Like, they took it very seriously.","startTime":"04:26","endTime":"04:29","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So they solved some of the big issues there.","startTime":"04:29","endTime":"04:33","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So props to them.","startTime":"04:33","endTime":"04:35","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I was like, I'm not staying there.","startTime":"04:35","endTime":"04:38","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I got soccer banquets and soccer practice and every other thing.","startTime":"04:38","endTime":"04:43","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So I popped in to help with some of the solutions.","startTime":"04:43","endTime":"04:45","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"But they, yeah, they're in the thick of it right now.","startTime":"04:45","endTime":"04:48","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Wow, that is beast mode.","startTime":"04:48","endTime":"04:50","speaker_name":"Debbie Herbert","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"Yeah, yeah, can't wait to see.","startTime":"04:50","endTime":"04:53","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Yeah, yeah, AI helped quite a bit.","startTime":"04:54","endTime":"04:59","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So it's funny because I won't belabor at this point, but like, Marcus uses AI quite a bit to generate like the concepts around the code and then the developers like.","startTime":"04:59","endTime":"05:09","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So he's like, I'm vibe coding.","startTime":"05:09","endTime":"05:10","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I'm just vibing, you know, I'm vibing with the AI and writing stuff.","startTime":"05:10","endTime":"05:13","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And the developers are like, yeah, this is riddled with issues.","startTime":"05:13","endTime":"05:16","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So we're trying to find the right balance between AI ideating and then AI generating the actual code.","startTime":"05:16","endTime":"05:24","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And I think we made some good, some good progress there.","startTime":"05:24","endTime":"05:27","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So.","startTime":"05:27","endTime":"05:28","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"But that's going well.","startTime":"05:29","endTime":"05:30","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I think it takes me back to my early accounting days when like to post things.","startTime":"05:31","endTime":"05:36","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"You had to code things into like an AS400 machine or something, you know, wasn't.","startTime":"05:36","endTime":"05:41","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, wasn't the easy stuff like we're.","startTime":"05:41","endTime":"05:43","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Going to talk about today.","startTime":"05:43","endTime":"05:44","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"05:44","endTime":"05:45","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":6},{"sentence":"So, okay, so we got a lot of work to do today.","startTime":"05:47","endTime":"05:50","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"05:51","endTime":"05:53","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Don't know how you want us to start or do you want us to share what we've done or.","startTime":"05:53","endTime":"05:58","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Yeah, we'll kind of hit the topics.","startTime":"05:59","endTime":"06:01","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I have just a lot of questions, so we can just talk through some topics.","startTime":"06:02","endTime":"06:06","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"The main goal is to get that all out onto the transcript so that we can absorb it and better put together.","startTime":"06:06","endTime":"06:11","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I think after this session, as long as we get through most of the topics, we will be in a good place to start creating the financial brd.","startTime":"06:11","endTime":"06:21","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"That's really the goal of this.","startTime":"06:21","endTime":"06:22","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Some of the other sections were actually really close on the BRDs because of how much were able to cover in the sessions on site.","startTime":"06:24","endTime":"06:30","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So we will be in good shape.","startTime":"06:31","endTime":"06:33","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"We will have in the coming weeks, like we just want to make sure that the BRDs are completely polished.","startTime":"06:34","endTime":"06:39","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Like, that is the kind of the book that we work from when we're implementing the account.","startTime":"06:39","endTime":"06:43","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So I, I don't know if I've talked to you guys about this, maybe just mentioned it in passing, but we take all of this documentation, we review it internally.","startTime":"06:44","endTime":"06:53","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"You know, Gary and Janine are creating drafts of the brd.","startTime":"06:54","endTime":"06:58","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I'm helping with some of that stuff, but we're just trying to, like, we have our original discovery questionnaire, everything that we need to answer in order to create a good brd.","startTime":"06:58","endTime":"07:07","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So we create the BRD as complete as possible.","startTime":"07:07","endTime":"07:10","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"We're categorizing things in terms of does it accommodate.","startTime":"07:10","endTime":"07:15","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I'm sorry, I'm using the wrong terminology already.","startTime":"07:15","endTime":"07:17","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Does it align with exactly how you guys are doing it and there's no change for either party.","startTime":"07:18","endTime":"07:24","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Do you guys need to adapt to how Orion does it, or do you guys have something special in your process that's making you win that we want to accommodate.","startTime":"07:25","endTime":"07:34","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Anything that ends up in that accommodate section on these BRDs warrants further conversation.","startTime":"07:35","endTime":"07:41","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So it could be anything.","startTime":"07:42","endTime":"07:44","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"It could be as small as, like, okay, we have to create a small saved search or a report that's pretty easy, low level.","startTime":"07:44","endTime":"07:50","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Like, it's not going to really affect the BRD or the statement of work at all.","startTime":"07:50","endTime":"07:54","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"It might be a script that adds a couple hours to the project, or it might be that we need to make a module specific for you guys.","startTime":"07:55","endTime":"08:02","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"If a module is made specific for you guys, it kind of falls into one of two buckets.","startTime":"08:03","endTime":"08:08","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"It's good for the entire dealer network and it gets added to the software either now or at some release in the future or, hey, this is really our special sauce.","startTime":"08:08","endTime":"08:19","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"We are willing to pay for this module, but we don't want the rest of the dealer network to have it.","startTime":"08:20","endTime":"08:25","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So that's kind of the big module stuff.","startTime":"08:26","endTime":"08:28","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So it's like if you need it and it will benefit the network, the dealer network, then we build that into the software and it's no cost to anybody that just comes out in a future release.","startTime":"08:28","endTime":"08:41","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"But we do have the benefit of working with somebody like you guys to kind of put together the requirements for that module and talk through it in that process.","startTime":"08:41","endTime":"08:50","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I'm sorry, remind me again what BRD stands for?","startTime":"08:51","endTime":"08:54","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Business Requirements Document.","startTime":"08:54","endTime":"08:56","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So basically what we're saying in that document is, hey, here's what we understand from going through the discovery process.","startTime":"08:57","endTime":"09:05","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Okay, Here is the current state, here is your business requirement, and this is how we approach each one of those business requirements.","startTime":"09:06","endTime":"09:15","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So like I said, each requirement is going to fall into one of those three buckets.","startTime":"09:16","endTime":"09:20","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Align, adapt, or accommodate.","startTime":"09:21","endTime":"09:23","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And we spell that all out right in the BRD.","startTime":"09:23","endTime":"09:26","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So then we hand these BRDs over to you guys and you review them.","startTime":"09:26","endTime":"09:30","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And that's a bit of a process, right, like you're going through making comments on it.","startTime":"09:30","endTime":"09:34","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I don't quite understand what you're talking about here.","startTime":"09:34","endTime":"09:36","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Can I have a little bit more clarification?","startTime":"09:36","endTime":"09:38","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Ideally it doesn't come down to like, no, you guys didn't get this, like, let's rewrite it.","startTime":"09:39","endTime":"09:43","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"But then we give you the BRDs, we walk through the commenting process and then we reconcile all those comments and then we issue a finalized BRD that you guys sign off on as this is specifically what we're going to do for this process

Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So, okay.","startTime":"38:30","endTime":"38:31","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":6},{"sentence":"Or order number is the most critical piece of

not.","startTime":"38:46","endTime":"38:51","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":6},{"sentence":"You know, this is all manual process.","startTime":"38:52","endTime":"38:54","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":6},{"sentence":"Expensify and Core don't speak to one another.","startTime":"38:54","endTime":"38:57","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":6},{"sentence":"So I don't know if that's going to change with Orion.","startTime":"38:57","endTime":"39:01","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":6},{"sentence":"I mean, hopefully it will.","startTime":"39:01","endTime":"39:02","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":6},{"sentence":"But yes, we do currently allow.","startTime":"39:02","endTime":"39:04","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":6},{"sentence":"There's no restriction on that, but if we have to divide those up, we can.","startTime":"39:04","endTime":"39:08","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":6},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"39:09","endTime":"39:09","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And then so if someone's like, I assume they're using like the Expensify mobile app and do they don't have.","startTime":"39:10","endTime":"39:18","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So there's no integration.","startTime":"39:18","endTime":"39:19","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So they don't have access to the actual order number.","startTime":"39:19","endTime":"39:22","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"They're just kind of cross referencing it.","startTime":"39:22","endTime":"39:24","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Like I'm going to put together my expense report and then I'm going to look in Core and I'm going to put the order number into that expense report, right?","startTime":"39:24","endTime":"39:32","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Yes, correct.","startTime":"39:33","endTime":"39:34","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":6},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"39:34","endTime":"39:34","speaker_name":"Lorraine

Guzman","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Is that correct, Kip that it's billable versus non billable.","startTime":"39:44","endTime":"39:48","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So if it's billable they click it and then they have to input this type of information in so that you know, it gets encoded correctly.","startTime":"39:48","endTime":"39:56","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So the thing that we'll need to look into once we select one or the other is because they both have NetSuite integration, would they have access directly to the orders that they are already a part of and they can just literally select the order rather than having to open up Orion and Expensify like basically like better tracking right in the app right there.","startTime":"39:57","endTime":"40:26","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Like do they have access to that kind of data or are they going to have to handle it the same way where they pull the order number out in that suite?","startTime":"40:26","endTime":"40:33","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Right, but that could be a pickup.","startTime":"40:34","endTime":"40:36","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"What else?","startTime":"40:40","endTime":"40:41","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"It was mentioned that the corporate card integration is difficult right

ramp.","startTime":"40:55","endTime":"40:59","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Like is ramp position to fix that in any way or like 100% it is.","startTime":"40:59","endTime":"41:05","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Okay, so that might be the headache worth solving by going to ramp.","startTime":"41:05","endTime":"41:10","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Okay, exactly.","startTime":"41:10","endTime":"41:11","speaker_name":"Lorraine

may want to make note of just because we're going to.","startTime":"41:13","endTime":"41:21","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":6},{"sentence":"I would like to solve for it is that typically when people are submitting expense reports that have job related costs on them, more often than not there isn't an existing line on that order to match that cost to.","startTime":"41:21","endTime":"41:36","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":6},{"sentence":"It's what we have to do is once expense report is submitted, we then have to go create a line, add it to the order.","startTime":"41:36","endTime":"41:42","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":6},{"sentence":"So there's Someone to job cost that.","startTime":"41:42","endTime":"41:44","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":6},{"sentence":"So anyway, that's just food for thought.","startTime":"41:44","endTime":"41:47","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":6},{"sentence":"Is that something that we could push a line to the order and apply that cost?","startTime":"41:47","endTime":"41:53","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":6},{"sentence":"Because that's another part of the process.","startTime":"41:54","endTime":"41:56","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":6},{"sentence":"It's manual right now.","startTime":"41:56","endTime":"41:57","speaker_name":"Kip

Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I mean.","startTime":"42:26","endTime":"42:27","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"No, because I think, I mean, Expensify works great.","startTime":"42:27","endTime":"42:31","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"It works fine.","startTime":"42:31","endTime":"42:32","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"There's a whole nice structure on.","startTime":"42:32","endTime":"42:34","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"On department and what

and post to.","startTime":"42:42","endTime":"42:44","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So we've set in the background, which works really

Guzman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So.","startTime":"43:03","endTime":"43:03","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So I mean, again, Expensify works good.","startTime":"43:03","endTime":"43:06","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"It's the credit card component that we.","startTime":"43:06","endTime":"43:09","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Have to go through Expensify and then we have a manual GEO headache to go through.","startTime":"43:09","endTime":"43:14","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Expensify in itself works fine and it ends up flowing and posting into our

fine.","startTime":"43:21","endTime":"43:22","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So I'm not dissing Exemptify at all.","startTime":"43:22","endTime":"43:27","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So it's a good dream.","startTime":"43:27","endTime":"43:28","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Dream of using Expensify.","startTime":"43:29","endTime":"43:30","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Like even, like when were on site with a client and there's a Netsuite rep there and he's like, oh, yeah, don't use, don't use NetSuite expenses.","startTime":"43:31","endTime":"43:38","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Like, that's a weak point for Netsuite.","startTime":"43:38","endTime":"43:41","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Like when I come home and set aside two hours collecting all my receipts and putting them into.","startTime":"43:41","endTime":"43:46","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Yeah, I think that, I mean, that's part of.","startTime":"43:46","endTime":"43:49","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"The only thing I think that's a little clunky of Expensify is that people.","startTime":"43:49","endTime":"43:53","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Still need to take time to do their expense reports.","startTime":"43:53","endTime":"43:56","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"43:56","endTime":"43:56","speaker_name":"Lorraine

and, you know, can take pictures with your phone and, you know, all sorts of bells and whistles.","startTime":"44:00","endTime":"44:05","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So it's a little bit more advanced, I think, than what we've seen to do with Expensify.","startTime":"44:05","endTime":"44:12","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But, but you'll like, you'll love Ramp because I mean, literally you'll get the text from Ramp before the waiter returns with your card and to sign.","startTime":"44:13","endTime":"44:22","speaker_name":"Gary

what.","startTime":"44:46","endTime":"44:49","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So again, this might turn into another session, but the idea that like we talked about, the sales team can see commissionable GP but they can't see the project gp.","startTime":"44:50","endTime":"45:02","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Like is that a hard requirement or a preference like setting some of those things up?","startTime":"45:03","endTime":"45:08","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I think it's a preference.","startTime":"45:10","endTime":"45:11","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Because again.","startTime":"45:14","endTime":"45:15","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We, we tried honestly, actual financial information is only the admins of Core right.","startTime":"45:15","endTime":"45:26","speaker_name":"Lorraine

everything and do everything and that's the way it should be for financial data.","startTime":"45:42","endTime":"45:50","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay, got.","startTime":"45:51","endTime":"45:52","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Is.","startTime":"45:54","endTime":"45:54","speaker_name":"Kevin Yin","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"I mean, it's a topic worth discussing though, because currently, I mean, the directors and account managers, they do have pretty free reign.","startTime":"45:54","endTime":"46:03","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":6},{"sentence":"If it's their project, they can open it up and see line item detail and they're not really

change that, I don't know.","startTime":"46:15","endTime":"46:22","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":6},{"sentence":"And that's kind of how we have it set up too, is at a project level, the people assigned to that project, especially the leadership, can see that data.","startTime":"46:23","endTime":"46:31","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"We would just need to be aware if there are any restrictions that we need to put in place and we have like these default permission roles and you know, as we get into implementation, we'll be kind of installing those roles into your account.","startTime":"46:31","endTime":"46:45","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"We can go through and see what they can see and what they can't see.","startTime":"46:45","endTime":"46:49","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"But if there are restrictions, it's like the earlier we know about that type of restriction, the better position we are to accommodate it early on.","startTime":"46:49","endTime":"46:57","speaker_name":"Chris

questions about when setting those up.","startTime":"47:00","endTime":"47:06","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"The ability to create Journal entries.","startTime":"47:07","endTime":"47:09","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Is that kind of that same group?","startTime":"47:09","endTime":"47:12","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Is it even smaller than the other admin group that you mentioned?","startTime":"47:12","endTime":"47:15","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Yes.","startTime":"47:16","endTime":"47:16","speaker_name":"Lorraine

direct report are also on the GL team.","startTime":"47:19","endTime":"47:24","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So those are the only people that can do journal entries as Celine, Kevin, myself and I don't even know if Kip can.","startTime":"47:24","endTime":"47:31","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Do you have access?","startTime":"47:31","endTime":"47:32","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But I don't think.","startTime":"47:33","endTime":"47:33","speaker_name":"Lorraine

don't ever do them.","startTime":"47:36","endTime":"47:38","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":6},{"sentence":"But yeah, admins have kind of free reign to do whatever.","startTime":"47:38","endTime":"47:41","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":6},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"47:42","endTime":"47:42","speaker_name":"Debbie

other.","startTime":"47:49","endTime":"47:55","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So if one can't, the other one can.","startTime":"47:55","endTime":"47:58","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So Kip should always be also

too.","startTime":"48:00","endTime":"48:07","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Just like the guy that has control over the

Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"No.","startTime":"48:31","endTime":"48:31","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So the AP team puts a recommendation for me, then I go through and.","startTime":"48:31","endTime":"48:37","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"I, I then approve what we're going to pay.","startTime":"48:37","endTime":"48:41","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I come up with a target and either then Kevin or Kip load it into the bank and then I can go

point.","startTime":"50:14","endTime":"50:15","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And it is in netsuite, I think it is dealing with like the actual printing of checks.","startTime":"50:16","endTime":"50:20","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Like that's where the permission is set.","startTime":"50:20","endTime":"50:22","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So.","startTime":"50:22","endTime":"50:22","speaker_name":"Chris

it's.","startTime":"54:31","endTime":"54:31","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":6},{"sentence":"It's never been very clear in core.","startTime":"54:31","endTime":"54:34","speaker_name":"Kip

can select.","startTime":"55:06","endTime":"55:18","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Like I want to see either just mine or I want to see mine and my teams or mine and my

two topics.","startTime":"55:32","endTime":"55:36","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And I'm sure that these are going to be bigger discussions, but talk a little bit about

that.","startTime":"55:41","endTime":"55:47","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So I think we came down to like it being around and I don't know if this is before or after

much?","startTime":"56:02","endTime":"56:03","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Fourth, it's listed here as $4,000.","startTime":"56:04","endTime":"56:06","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I just want to get an actual quote on that because I don't know if that's before or after discount.","startTime":"56:06","endTime":"56:11","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So it's per year.","startTime":"56:11","endTime":"56:12","speaker_name":"Chris

Guzman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"56:14","endTime":"56:15","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Is that something that I'd like to see because again, the capabilities of it, again being all in netsuite might beneficial for us then to continue in Bloomberg.","startTime":"56:16","endTime":"56:26","speaker_name":"Lorraine

Guzman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"56:32","endTime":"56:33","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":6},{"sentence":"What are the, what are the critical aspects of Bloomberg

me?","startTime":"56:41","endTime":"56:43","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Again, obviously the book stuff, you know, but really it's the tax component, the tax depreciation, the tax things, because those are very specific reports we have to run for our auditors.","startTime":"56:43","endTime":"56:54","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay, all right, that's good to know.","startTime":"56:55","endTime":"56:57","speaker_name":"Chris

Guzman","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Is that where it does the evaluation?","startTime":"57:15","endTime":"57:17","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay, so that's something else we need to talk about because I don't know if then this netSuite module, does that the leases in there or is.","startTime":"57:17","endTime":"57:26","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"There a, is there a separate module for that?","startTime":"57:26","endTime":"57:30","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Well, there's like some leasing management built into NetSuite.","startTime":"57:30","endTime":"57:35","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I have to look at what actually.","startTime":"57:35","endTime":"57:36","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":6},{"sentence":"It does and if it applies to this.","startTime":"57:36","endTime":"57:38","speaker_name":"Chris Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"But I know that there is ability to manage some of

Trumble","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Yeah, so with fixed assets, you get their lease component.","startTime":"57:41","endTime":"57:46","speaker_name":"Gary Strickland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I Would say if you're used to something like Lease query or a little bit more sophisticated, yeah, netsuite's probably not going to meet your requirements.","startTime":"57:46","endTime":"57:54","speaker_name":"Gary Strickland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You're going to want to stay with least query.","startTime":"57:54","endTime":"57:55","speaker_name":"Gary Strickland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But we can look at it.","startTime":"57:55","endTime":"57:56","speaker_name":"Gary

Strickland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"58:00","endTime":"58:00","speaker_name":"Kevin Yin","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"So, okay, that's something we need to.","startTime":"58:01","endTime":"58:03","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Definitely look at because obviously the capability.","startTime":"58:03","endTime":"58:05","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Of dropping in the key metrics and.","startTime":"58:05","endTime":"58:08","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Then it coming back and saying, oh.","startTime":"58:08","endTime":"58:10","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"No, this is an operating lease.","startTime":"58:10","endTime":"58:11","speaker_name":"Lorraine

that now?","startTime":"58:14","endTime":"58:15","speaker_name":"Gary Strickland","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Or is that all.","startTime":"58:15","endTime":"58:16","speaker_name":"Gary

that.","startTime":"58:32","endTime":"58:34","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So I don't know.","startTime":"58:34","endTime":"58:35","speaker_name":"Lorraine
