## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Financial Management at KBM Hoag involves a lean but mighty finance team managing a $100M dealer operation with a complex cost structure, 13-period accounting calendar, multi-workspace consolidation, and sophisticated project accounting. The current Core system has limitations in areas like chart of accounts management (40+ pages), period close process (10 days via Excel), limited labor markup automation (15% contingency line), and manual expense management through Expensify. NetSuite/Orion will enable automation through bank feeds, electronic bill payments, integrated expense management, automated period close checklists, and improved financial reporting with real-time dashboards.

**Key Themes:**
- Lean finance team managing $100M operations
- 15% labor markup (cost-only contingency line)  
- Project GP vs. Commissionable GP distinction
- Chart of accounts simplification (40+ pages â†’ few hundred accounts)
- 10-day period close (Excel-based currently)
- Bank feeds and electronic payments (ACH/wire)
- Expensify integration for expense management
- 13 accounting periods, calendar year
- Fixed asset management (Bloomberg currently, evaluating NetSuite module)

## FINANCE TEAM STRUCTURE

### Team Members

**Core Finance Team:**
- **Lorraine** - CFO/Controller ("mighty finance team... lean, but mighty GP")
- **Guada** - Accounts Payable (Dynamic Duo #1)
- **Michael** - Accounts Payable, Philippines-based (Dynamic Duo #2)
- **Celine** - General Ledger  
- **Kevin** - General Ledger
- **[AR Person]** - San Jose office

**Finance Partner:**
- **Kipp** - Former Controller, now IT specialist
  - "He touches everything"
  - "Free safety" (football analogy)
  - Still leveraged heavily for finance duties
  - 15 years at company
  - Involved in all finance-related decisions

**Quote from Speaker:**
"The other finance partner is Kip, because he has his hands in everything that we do. He's everywhere. He's got the ball trades. The free safety... He used to be a controller here. And then he went in and specialized into IT kind of stuff, but he still kept a lot of his duties, and we still leverage him for a lot of stuff that he does on board."

## COMPANY STRUCTURE & SETUP

### Subsidiary Structure

**Decision: One Subsidiary**
- Single NetSuite subsidiary
- KB + Hoag merged operations
- Consolidated financial reporting
- Locations for different offices/warehouses

### Accounting Periods

**Current (Core):**
- 12 accounting periods
- Calendar year basis

**Future (NetSuite):**
- **13 accounting periods** (Lorraine's preference)
- Calendar year (January 1 - December 31)
- "I would like 13. 13. Core only does 12. Okay. So it was, like, 13. Yep."

**Period Management:**
- Open whole year at once
- Set December reminder to open next year
- Avoid opening more than one year in advance (prevents future-date transaction errors)
- Can close AP/AR separately from GL through checklist

### Currency

**US Dollar Only:**
- No multi-currency requirements
- All operations in USD
- "We're all in U.S. dollar"

---

## TAX MANAGEMENT

### Sales Tax - SuiteTax

**Implementation:**
- 48 states with nexus registration
- Automatic calculation based on ship-to address
- Native SuiteTax (not Avalara)
- Tax exemption certificate management
- Effective date tracking
- Dashboard for expiring certificates
- Compliance reporting

**Benefits:**
- "You get a beautiful report"
- Automatic application once customer certificate loaded
- No manual intervention needed for future quotes

**Government Orders Tax Complexity:**
- See Order Management transcript for detailed Miller Knoll direct bill tax issues
- Tax override capability available when needed

### Use Tax

**States Requiring Use Tax:**
- Illinois
- Missouri
- Different nexus definitions
- Current: TaxConnect third party handles
- Core won't do use tax: "have to kind of trick it"

**Kipp Quote:**
"There... yeah, they're the exceptions there, or else it's sales tax. And CORE won't do use tax, so we have to kind of trick it."

### Gross Receipts Tax

**Requirement:**
- Generate reports based on ship-to location
- Currently: Data dump from Core
- "Run it so infrequently, I'm sure it's on my calendar"

**NetSuite Solution:**
- Standard SuiteTax report
- Ship-to location is standard calculation method
- Native functionality, no custom development

**Kipp:**
"We need the sales... sales revenue number based on ship to location. Is that something we would set up?"

**Marcus:**
"That's... isn't ship to location is the standard way of calculating it, right? Yes, exactly. So then, yeah, that's... that'll be your sweet text report, your native suitext report."

### Fixed Asset Tax Depreciation

**Current State:**
- Bloomberg (third party) for tax depreciation
- Book depreciation vs. tax depreciation

**NetSuite Option:**
- Fixed Asset (FA) module available
- Additional cost (~$4,000)
- Need to determine if NetSuite can meet all needs
- "I think the fixed asset module's gonna handle what you need"

**Decision Point:**
- Evaluate NetSuite FA module vs. continuing Bloomberg
- Open question during discovery

---

## JOURNAL ENTRIES & ALLOCATIONS

### Journal Entry Functionality

**Import Capability:**
- CSV import of journal entries
- Payroll entries imported from Paylocity
- Can do department allocations before import
- Automated reversal journal entries

**Reversal Entries:**

**Lorraine:**
"That practice, though? Oh, you have? Okay. Because we couldn't keep track of them."

**Current Challenge:**
- Core doesn't have automated reversal
- Tracking reversals manually is problematic

**NetSuite Benefit:**
- Automatic reversal journal entries
- Better tracking
- One scenario planned for automated reversal (to be detailed later)

### Allocations

**Current State:**
- Manual allocations
- "P&Ls that show allocation, they're just on paper"
- Don't create allocation transactions in Core
- "We don't have it"

**Future State (NetSuite):**
- Optional to implement
- Decision pending with leadership
- "I don't know that he knows that he wants to, or doesn't"
- "These numbers were never offered heavy"

**Implication:**
- May continue manual/paper allocations
- NetSuite capability available if needed

---

## BANKING & CASH MANAGEMENT

### Cash Flow Forecasting

**NetSuite Feature:**
- Cache360 Dashboard
- Cash flow forecasting functionality
- Part of configured system
- Pro forma invoice as additional data point (doesn't auto-flow to dashboard)

### Bank Feeds

**Current Bank:**
- West Coast Community Bank
- Confirmed as part of NetSuite Bank Feeds program

**Functionality:**
- Automatic transaction feed into NetSuite
- Auto-matching capability
- Create rules to improve matching over time
- Similar process for both bank and credit card reconciliation

**Benefit:**
- Automated reconciliation
- Reduced manual data entry
- Rule-based matching improves over time

### Electronic Bill Payments (ACH)

**Current Process:**
- Run check run in Core
- Generate HTML file (NACHA format)
- Log into bank portal
- Upload file
- Verify amounts
- Bank pushes payments to vendors

**NetSuite Capability:**
- **Advanced Electronic Bill Payments** (part of edition)
- Pay via ACH directly from NetSuite
- Vendor prepayments support (newer feature)
- Skip manual bank portal upload step
- "Payments get pushed to vendors straight from [NetSuite]"

**Fallback:**
- If bank integration issue: NACHA file upload
- Similar to current process
- "Depends on what template your bank uses"

**Service Provider:**
- Register with Coastal (or similar service)
- Third-party payment processor

**Current Volume:**
- 90% ACH
- Handful of wires (international only - expensive)
- Some credit card activity

**Wire Transfers:**
- Wires restricted to international (expensive)
- ACH is cheap
- Module question: ACH only or wire support too?
- If not integrated: Manual entry in bank portal (current process for wires)

### Payment Approval Workflow

**Current Process:**
- Guada or Michael compile proposed payment run
- Bring to Lorraine with amounts (sometimes $3M)
- "They always try to kill me with the amounts, because they'd just erode all our cash"
- Lorraine reviews and approves
- AP team must click to pay in Core
- Lorraine picks and chooses
- AP team unchecks items Lorraine rejects

**NetSuite Process:**
- Similar approval workflow
- Bill payment transaction pays multiple bills
- Payment method defines ACH vs. other
- Supervisor approval required
- AP compiles, Lorraine approves
- Open question: Can Lorraine remove items or must communicate back to AP?

**Monday Payment Process:**
- Regular Monday payment runs
- Proposed run brought to Lorraine
- Selection/approval process
- Then execution

**Action Items:**
- Confirm exact approval workflow steps
- Determine if approver can edit payment selection
- Confirm remittance process (automatic or manual trigger)
- "If it said we sent it and we didn't, then, you know, that's a problem" (Lorraine concern)

### Positive Pay

**Current Requirement:**
- Must go into bank portal for positive pay review
- Validates transactions

**NetSuite Question:**
- Bank connected to NetSuite
- Validate transactions in NetSuite
- Still need bank portal for positive pay?
- "Haven't talked to the bank about being connected to NetSuite"
- "Our current process requires us to do that, but we don't know if the new process will require us to do"

**Action Item:**
- Confirm with bank: Positive pay process with NetSuite bank feeds
- Determine if bank portal still needed

---

## CREDIT CARD MANAGEMENT

### Corporate Credit Cards

**Current Bank:**
- ARC Bank
- "Very manual process, how we get it into the GL"

**NetSuite Approach:**
- Treat credit card like another bank account
- Upload statement (likely CSV)
  - Not live feed (likely)
  - Manual export/import
- Use same reconciliation process as bank account
- "A lot easier"

**Benefit:**
- Consistent reconciliation process
- Automated matching
- Reduced manual entry

### Expense Management - Expensify

**Current Process:**
1. Users create expense reports in Expensify
2. Attach receipts
3. Code transactions
4. System generates file
5. AP team manually downloads
6. Manual coding into GL
7. "Obviously a lot of work there up front"

**User Challenge:**
- Matt has "a lot of lines that he has to manage"
- Matt: "I just don't do it. I supposed that my others are cold."
- Manual reconciliation of expense reports to bank statement

**NetSuite Solution:**
- **Expensify Integration** (Suite App available)
- "Absolutely talk to each other. You can just sync data"
- Automated data sync from Expensify to NetSuite
- Receipts attached in Expensify flow to NetSuite

**Alternative: RAMP**
- Lorraine interested in moving from Expensify to RAMP
- RAMP has NetSuite integration too
- "RAM doesn't have an integration with NetSuite. It does? Yes."
- Could potentially demo both

**User Experience Benefit:**
- Receipt capture from phone
- "Boom, get actually assigned to it"
- Simplified expense submission
- "Who likes to do expense reports? That's why I made Chris buy everything"

**Action Item:**
- Evaluate Expensify vs. RAMP integration
- Demo both if needed
- Determine which better fits workflow

### Expense Report Allocation

**Cost Structure Question:**
- Travel reimbursement allocation
- Two different cost categories:
  1. **Cost of Goods Sold** - project costs (specific project allocation)
  2. **G&A** - general administrative expenses

**Lorraine:**
"We have a... we have two different... Again, our cost structure. our COA, we had to, create a cost to go into cost of goods sold, specifically identified as a project cost, and then we have general G&A-type stuff"

**Implication:**
- Expense reports must allocate to project or G&A
- Project-related travel = COGS
- General travel = G&A
- Integration must support project coding

### Accepting Credit Card Payments

**NetSuite Capability:**
- Can accept credit cards
- PCI/DSS compliant
- Multiple payment processors available

**Current State: Stripe**
- Payment link embedded in invoice hyperlink
- URL sent to clients for payment portal
- "She built it for us, and she's hosting it"
- Pay annual hosting fee (~$100)

**Frequency:**
- "Very rare we take a credit card"
- Try to avoid because of fees
- But available as option for clients

**Processing Fees:**
- Plan on 3% (rewards cards cost more)
- "Rewards cards, you get homes with those rewards cards. It's the biggest scam ever. Get the merchant pay for it."
- Stripe: Transaction-based pricing only (no monthly fee currently)

**NetSuite Options:**
- Multiple payment processors available
- All charge similar transaction fees
- Fee based on transaction volume
- Could consolidate if NetSuite option equivalent

**Primary Use Case:**
- Payment link in invoice for convenience
- Self-service payment portal
- Most dealers use for this reason

**Decision:**
- Stay with Stripe currently (works fine, incidental use)
- No rush to change
- "If you're using Stripe, you're fine, and if you... it's, like, incidental, then..." (Marcus)

## 15% LABOR MARKUP (CONTINGENCY LINE)

### The Practice

**Automatic Calculation:**
- Core rule: If labor line entered (product code = labor)
- System automatically adds 15% line
- Example: $100 labor â†’ auto-add $15 line

**Purpose:**
"It's encouraging people to put bigger margins on labor, because labor is inherently unpredictable. Product, very predictable, you spend in the PO, you get back in development, it's not gonna change. Labor, you're guessing. Until you get in the field and start doing things."

**Nature:**
- Cost-only line (no revenue impact)
- Bookkeeping mechanism
- "Never really any... it's just the bookkeeping thing"
- Never cost-prove against these lines
- No external impact

### Financial Impact

**General Ledger:**
- "There's no GL impact"
- Doesn't hit actual financials

**Project GP:**
- Inflates cost
- Reduces margin
- Affects project GP calculations
- **Affects commission** (commission paid after the 15% reduces GP)

**Load Factor Concept:**
- Functions as load factor
- Covers risk/contingency
- Meant to cover labor unpredictability

### Industry Comparison

**Other Dealers:**
- Common practice, but usually lower percentage
- Typically 3% load factor
- Covers design and PM time
- Usually calculated as 3% of **revenue** (vs. KBM's 15% of **cost**)

**Why KBM's is Higher:**
- 15% of cost vs. others' 3% of revenue
- Different calculation base
- "That's why it's higher"

### Two GP Metrics

**Project GP:**
- True gross profit
- All revenue minus all costs
- What management monitors
- Year-to-date view shows true margin

**Commissionable GP:**
- Includes 15% labor markup
- Reduces apparent GP
- Used for commission calculation
- Different KPI set

**Kipp:**
"In order to see the true margin of the projects, then we have to run year-to-date data then, right? So, it flats out. So, what we do is, that's why we have two... that's why we have a different set of KPIs. So, we have a set of KPIs for project gross profit, and then we have commissionable gross profit, and then commissionable gross profit includes things like the head factor."

**Permission Control:**
- Different people see different KPIs
- Role-based visibility
- Sales may see commissionable GP
- Management sees true project GP

### Future of 15% Rule

**Up for Debate:**
- "That may be up for debate as to whether or not we would want to keep that"
- Matt and Mark decision
- Kipp mentioned Matt was discussing it
- Kipp: "I'd be completely in favor of getting rid of it, but I don't... that's not my [decision]"

**Commission Impact:**
- "Commission is paid on that"
- Changing it would affect commission calculations
- Significant operational change

**Decision:**
- Will ask Matt/Mark for final decision
- May continue or eliminate
- Can be replicated in NetSuite if continuing

## PERIOD CLOSE PROCESS

### Current Process

**Timeline:**
- **10 days** to close accounting period
- All managed via Excel
- No system-guided process

**Tools:**
- Excel for tracking
- Manual checklist
- No integrated close management

**Previous Experience (Lorraine):**
- Used Blackline or Flowcast in prior roles
- Online systems for close management
- Connect to ERP but separate tool
- Attach documents and track progress

### NetSuite Period Close

**Built-in Checklist:**
- Period closing checklist feature
- Step-by-step process
- Quick walk-through mode
- System-guided close
- "Pretty quick"

**Recommendation:**
- Use NetSuite native checklist (Marcus)
- No need for separate Blackline/Flowcast

**Module Closing:**

**Current Core:**
- AP/AR module close separately from GL module
- Can open/close individually

**NetSuite:**
- Can close AP/AR separately and go through checklist
- Flexible closing process
- Close modules as ready

### Period Opening

**Best Practice (Marcus):**
- Open entire year at once
- Set December reminder to open next year
- Prevents forgetting in January
- "Can't tell you how many times we stumbled into January and we couldn't do transactions, because we've got to open up the next accounting period year"

**Caution:**
- Don't open more than one year ahead
- Risk: People select future transaction dates by mistake
- Throws off reporting

**13-Period Calendar:**
- Open all 13 periods for year
- Close periods as completed
- Ability to reopen if needed

---

## CHART OF ACCOUNTS

### Current State

**Volume:**
- **40+ pages of accounts** in Core
- Unwieldy and difficult to manage
- Need for consolidation

**Target State:**
- **"Few hundred accounts"** (target reduction)
- Streamlined structure
- Cleaner reporting

**Workspaces:**
- KB workspace accounts
- Hoag workspace accounts  
- Consolidated view needed

### Historical Data

**Retention Decision:**
- Back to **2017** (Lorraine's decision)
- "Historical data back to 2017"
- Older data exported and archived
- Separate archive system

**Lorraine:**
"Fee side and view side data usage" - determine what's truly needed

### Data Migration Strategy

**Typical Approach:**
- End-of-month trial balances
- 2-5 years typical import
- Up to 10 years possible
- CSV import process
- Period-over-period reporting capability

**Core Data Export:**
- SQL backend access confirmed
- Data migration tool available
- Strategy: Avoid Core involvement (backdoor access)
- Direct data extraction

---

## CUSTOMER FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

### Finance Charges

**Capability:**
- Global on/off switch
- Shows on statements and invoices
- Automatic calculation if enabled

**Current Use:**
- **Never implemented in 13 years** (Lorraine)
- Deterrent/threat only
- "Most dealers want to threaten. They don't actually follow through, which I get it because you want to keep your customers happy, too"

**Functionality:**
- 90-day invoice â†’ auto-add finance charge line
- Or manually add as line item
- Typically not used

### Storage Fees

**See Order Management transcript for full details**

**Summary:**
- Vary by warehouse (30-90 days free)
- Bill back to client (typically)
- Mark up storage costs
- Sometimes absorbed as customer accommodation
- Impact on commission (line-level marking)

### Project Accounting

**Two GP Concepts:**

1. **Project GP** - True gross profit (everyone monitors)
2. **Commissionable GP** - For commission calculation (includes 15% labor markup)

**Line-Level Commission Marking:**
- Individual lines marked commissionable or not
- Header: Who gets commission, percentage/split
- Flexibility for storage fees, accommodations, etc.

**Time Tracking Impact:**
- Internal labor rates affect project GP
- External contractor rates
- Manual reconciliation
- GP impact tracking

---

## ACCOUNTS PAYABLE MANAGEMENT

### Vendor Management

**Intermarket:**
- Dealers must be set up as both vendor AND customer
- Pain point for first-time dealer setup

**Live Budget Tracking:**
- Google Docs for live budget
- Collaborative, real-time changes
- Then â†’ create proposal (static)
- No changes after proposal
- "We really live in a world of collapsed"

### NetSuite Approach

**Separate Transactions:**
- Opportunity â†’ Quote â†’ Sales Order
- Each transaction separate and linked
- Better audit trail
- Can compare quote to sales order (if changes occur)

**Project-Level Tracking:**
- All transactions linked to project
- Project-level revenue/cost aggregation
- KPI dashboard at project level

**Recognition Timing:**
- Decision point: When does revenue recognize?
- Typically at sales order or invoice
- May need special rules for certain order types

**White Paper:**
- Marcus mentioned working on white paper
- Review on screen during session
- Detail NetSuite revenue recognition differences

**Note:** Full revenue recognition discussion likely continued but not captured in transcript excerpts reviewed.

- "I would like 13. 13. Core only does 12."

**On Period Opening:**
- "I can't tell you how many times we stumbled into January and we couldn't do transactions, because we've got to open up the next accounting period year."

**On Labor Markup:**
- "Product, very predictable, you spend in the PO, you get back in development, it's not gonna change. Labor, you're guessing. Until you get in the field and start doing things."

**On Two GP Metrics:**
- "That's why we have two... that's why we have a different set of KPIs. So, we have a set of KPIs for project gross profit, and then we have commissionable gross profit"

**On Payment Runs:**
- "They always try to kill me with the amounts, because they'd just erode all our cash." (Lorraine on proposed $3M payment runs)

**On Credit Card Fees:**

**On Manual Processes:**

**On Reversal Journal Entries:**
- "We couldn't keep track of them" (why they stopped using reversals in Core)

**On Period Close:**
- "We do everything on... in Excel." (current period close checklist)

**On Fixed Assets:**
- "I just want to know if NetSuite can meet our needs, and do we need that fixed asset stuff? [We're] paying for a third party to do that."

**On Use Tax:**
- "CORE won't do use tax, so we have to kind of trick it."
