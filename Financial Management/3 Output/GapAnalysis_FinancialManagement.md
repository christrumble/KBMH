## 3. INFORMATION GAPS ANALYSIS

### 3.1 Critical Priority Gaps (üî¥ Must Address for Configuration)

#### GAP 1: 15% Labor Markup Continuation Decision
- **Missing Information**: Matt/Mark strategic decision on whether to continue 15% labor markup practice
- **Why Important**: Affects commission calculations, custom development scope, sales compensation structure
- **Current State**: Core automatically adds 15% cost line when labor entered; commission paid after markup reduces GP
- **Who Has Answer**: Matt/Mark (Leadership)
- **How to Get**: Dedicated commission structure session (Session 3)
- **Related REQs**: REQ-023 (labor markup decision), REQ-024 (dual GP metrics), REQ-025 (role-based permissions)
- **Impact**: High - If continuing, requires custom script development; if eliminating, major process and commission impact

#### GAP 2: Revenue Recognition Rules by Order Type
- **Missing Information**: Detailed revenue recognition timing and rules for each order type (standard, mockup, direct bill, intermarket, government, e-commerce)
- **Why Important**: Compliance-critical; errors impact financials and audit requirements
- **Current State**: "Sales order = revenue recognition" but special scenarios need definition
- **Who Has Answer**: Lorraine (CFO), Kipp (Finance/IT), Operations team for process context
- **How to Get**: Dedicated revenue recognition session (Session 1), white paper review
