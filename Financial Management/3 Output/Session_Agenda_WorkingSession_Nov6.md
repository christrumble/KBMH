## DETAILED SESSION AGENDA

### **SECTION 1: CHART OF ACCOUNTS DESIGN (90 MINUTES)**

#### **Pre-Session Requirement** ⚠️ CRITICAL
- ✅ Celine/Kevin: Export complete Core COA (all account numbers, descriptions, types, usage frequency)
- ✅ Pre-identify top 50 most-used accounts
- ✅ Pre-identify obvious duplicate/rarely-used accounts
- ✅ Bring any existing consolidation ideas/drafts

#### **1A: Pre-Work Validation (5 minutes)**
**Facilitator**: Celine/Kevin  
**Objective**: Confirm data quality and completeness

**Questions:**
1. Is the COA export complete (all 40+ pages)?
2. Does it include usage frequency/activity data?
3. Are the top 50 most-used accounts clearly marked?
4. Have you pre-identified duplicate accounts?

**Outcome**: Data ready to work with or need to defer session

---

#### **1B: Usage Analysis - Most-Used vs. Rarely-Used Accounts (25 minutes)**
**Facilitator**: Lorraine (CFO) + Celine/Kevin (GL)  
**Objective**: Understand account utilization to guide consolidation strategy

**Questions:**

**1. Usage Frequency Definition**
- How many accounts appear on a typical monthly trial balance?
- How many accounts receive >100 transactions per year?
- How many accounts receive only 5-10 transactions per year?
- Define your threshold: What constitutes "most-used" vs. "rarely-used"?

**2. Account Activity Patterns**
- Does account usage vary significantly by month? (e.g., seasonal projects?)
- Are there accounts used only during period close? (Accruals, allocations?)
- Are there accounts used only annually? (Year-end adjustments?)
- Any accounts that should be active but aren't being used?

**3. Geographic/Divisional Patterns**
- Do KB and Hoag use different accounts?
- Are there location-specific accounts that could consolidate?
- Any project-specific accounts that should be standardized?

**4. Operational Insights**
- Which accounts do users struggle with? (Frequently misused, confusion over naming?)
- Which accounts generate the most GL reconciliation issues?
- Any accounts that should have higher activity but don't?

**Expected Outcome**: Clear picture of account usage patterns; identification of candidates for consolidation

---

#### **1C: Duplicate & Redundant Account Analysis (15 minutes)**
**Facilitator**: Celine/Kevin + Lorraine  
**Objective**: Map consolidation candidates and prioritize

**Questions:**

**1. Duplicate Identification**
- Which accounts serve the same purpose but have different numbers?
- Example: Multiple "Labor" accounts, multiple "Materials" accounts?
- Are there accounts with identical descriptions and different numbers?
- Why were these duplicates created? (Different divisions? Different time periods? Error?)

**2. Consolidation Candidates (Prioritize by Feasibility)**
- **Tier 1 - Easy Consolidates** (No process impact): Which duplicates can merge immediately?
- **Tier 2 - Moderate** (Minor coding change): Which need user training but simple consolidation?
- **Tier 3 - Complex** (Major process impact): Which require operational changes before consolidating?
- **Tier 4 - Keep Separate** (Must remain distinct): Which duplicates must stay for audit/regulatory reasons?

**3. Historical Data Impact**
- For each Tier 1 & 2 consolidation: Will consolidation affect historical reporting?
- Which old accounts need to be archived but remain accessible for historical GL reports?
- Which consolidations require remapping historical transactions vs. starting fresh in NetSuite?

**Expected Outcome**: Prioritized list of consolidation candidates with business impact assessment

---

#### **1D: Target COA Structure & Design Philosophy (40 minutes)**
**Facilitator**: Lorraine (CFO) + Marcus (Implementation)  
**Objective**: Design new COA structure that consolidates from 40+ pages to "few hundred"

**Questions:**

**1. Current State Root Cause Analysis**
- **Root Question**: What's causing the 40+ page expansion?
  - Too many specific accounts (not enough consolidation)?
  - Different divisions/locations each have their own accounts?
  - Lack of segmentation using Classes/Departments/Projects?
  - Historical accounts never cleaned up?

**2. Target Structure & Numbers**
- Specific target: Is "few hundred" your actual target, or do you want a specific number?
  - Conservative: 250-300 accounts (aggressive consolidation)?
  - Moderate: 300-400 accounts (balanced)?
  - Flexible: 400-500 accounts (room for future growth)?
- **Decision Point 1**: Commit to a specific target range

**3. Account Categories & Structure**
**For each category below, define the structure:**

**Revenue Accounts:**
  - How many distinct revenue types? (Labor, materials, services, other, e-commerce?)
  - Should these have separate GL accounts or be consolidated with project/class segmentation?
  - Examples: Do you have "Labor - KB", "Labor - Hoag", "Labor - Intermarket"? → Consolidate to single "Labor Revenue" + class segmentation?

**Cost of Goods Sold (Project Costs):**
  - Structure: One "COGS" account with project coding, or separate accounts by cost type?
  - Sub-categories: Do you need COGS broken down by (Labor, Materials, Subcontractors, Other)?
  - Historical tracking: Do projects need separate GL accounts, or can you use NetSuite's Project costing module?

**General & Administrative Expenses:**
  - How many distinct expense categories do you TRULY need vs. nice-to-have?
  - Could many be consolidated and segmented using Departments instead of separate accounts?
  - Examples: Facility costs, Technology, Personnel, Professional Services, Marketing, Travel?

**Equity, Fixed Assets, Other Balance Sheet:**
  - Do KB/Hoag have separate equity accounts or consolidated?
  - Are fixed assets tracked by type or consolidated to one account with NetSuite FA module?

**4. The 15% Labor Markup Impact** (From prior discovery)
- Current state: The 15% markup is coded to its own GL line
- **Decision Point 2**: Will you keep 15% markup as separate account or consolidate it?
- If keeping separate: Does this impact your target account count?
- If consolidating: Does this require operational changes?

**5. Segmentation Strategy: Accounts vs. Classes/Departments/Projects**
- **NetSuite Capability**: Instead of 500 accounts, could you use 150 accounts + heavy use of Classes/Departments?
- Example: Instead of "Labor-KB", "Labor-Hoag", "Labor-Field", "Labor-Project-A", use one "Labor Revenue" account with Class/Project segmentation?
- **Question for Lorraine/Kipp**: Which reporting dimensions matter most?
  - By location (KB vs. Hoag)?
  - By function (direct labor, overhead, project support)?
  - By project?
  - By customer?
- **Decision Point 3**: How much account proliferation vs. class/department segmentation?

**6. Account Numbering Scheme**
- Current scheme: (Ask Celine/Kevin what it is)
- Proposed scheme: Standard ranges like:
  - 1000-1999: Assets
  - 2000-2999: Liabilities
  - 3000-3999: Equity
  - 4000-4999: Revenue
  - 5000-5999: COGS
  - 6000-6999: Operating Expenses
  - Etc.
- **Decision Point 4**: Do you want this standard numbering or keep your current scheme?

**Expected Outcome**: 
- ✅ Target COA structure approved (specific account ranges, categories)
- ✅ Specific account count target committed
- ✅ Segmentation strategy defined (accounts vs. classes/departments)
- ✅ Numbering scheme proposed
- ✅ Preliminary decisions on 15% markup account handling

---

#### **1E: Chart of Accounts Mapping & Implementation Approach (5 minutes)**
**Facilitator**: Lorraine + Celine/Kevin  
**Objective**: Confirm mapping strategy and go-live approach

**Questions:**

1. **Mapping Logistics**
   - Old COA → New COA mapping will be created by implementation team and reviewed by you, correct?
   - Timeline: When do you need the mapping document? (For review before NetSuite config?)

2. **Go-Live Cutover**
   - What month/year will you switch to new COA in NetSuite?
   - Will you run parallel reports (old COA vs. new COA) for validation? (Recommended)
   - Fallback: If issues discovered post-cutover, how quickly can you revert?

3. **User Training & Change Management**
   - Primary users impacted: Sales (GL coding), AP (bill coding), AR (invoice coding), Expense reporters?
   - Training approach: Reference guide, hands-on training, desk-side support?
   - **Note for PM**: This is a change management project in addition to system configuration

**Expected Outcome**: 
- ✅ Mapping document assigned to implementation team
- ✅ Go-live cutover date tentatively identified
- ✅ User communication/training approach acknowledged

---

### **SECTION 2: CRITICAL UNANSWERED QUESTIONS - RAPID DECISIONS (45 MINUTES)**

**Objective**: Address the 4 highest-priority unanswered questions with quick decisions

**Format**: 10-12 minutes per question, with clear decision/action at end of each

---

#### **2A: Event-Based Invoice Triggers (12 minutes)**
**Facilitator**: Lorraine + Kipp  
**Decision Maker**: Lorraine  
**Business Impact**: Revenue recognition timing, invoice automation, cash flow

**Background** (From your outstanding questions):
> *"What specific system events will trigger the final invoice? (shipment confirmation, fulfillment status, work order completion?)"*

**Questions to Ask:**

1. **Standard Project Flow**
   - Walk me through a typical project from order to invoice
   - At what specific point do you recognize revenue? (Sales order? Order acknowledgment? Shipment? Delivery? Invoice?)
   - At what point do you generate the invoice? (Same as revenue recognition point, or different?)
   - **Example Scenario**: "We recognize revenue on shipment confirmation, but invoice only after delivery sign-off" — is that your pattern?

2. **Order Type Variations**
   - **Standard Projects**: Event = ?
   - **Direct Bill Orders**: Event = ?
   - **E-Commerce Orders**: Event = ?
   - **Mockup Orders**: Event = ?
   - **Government Orders**: Event = ?

3. **Timeline Requirements**
   - How quickly after the event must the invoice be generated? (Same day? Next day? Within 3 days?)
   - Is invoice generation automatic or manual approval-based?

4. **System Integration Points**
   - Will the triggering event come from a system?
     - Order fulfillment system (separate from NetSuite)?
     - Shipment confirmation (manual entry in NetSuite)?
     - Work order completion (NetSuite Projects module)?
   - Does this event need to flow into NetSuite automatically, or will someone manually trigger the invoice?

**Decision Point**: 
- Clarify invoice trigger events by order type
- Confirm revenue recognition timing vs. invoice timing (same or different?)
- Identify automation opportunity vs. manual process

**Outcome**: Document goes to implementation team for system design

---

#### **2B: Commission Plan Validation - Can Two "Convoluted" Plans Be Supported? (12 minutes)**
**Facilitator**: Lorraine + Kipp  
**Decision Maker**: Matt/Mark (if available; otherwise Lorraine)  
**Business Impact**: Sales compensation accuracy, custom development scope

**Background** (From your outstanding questions):
> *"Can the two 'convoluted' employee plans be supported in Orion? Need to review specific plan structures."*

**Questions to Ask:**

1. **Commission Plan A Details**
   - Name of Plan A?
   - Commission calculation formula? (e.g., "% of Gross Profit", "% of Labor Revenue", "Tiered based on GP%"?)
   - Who receives this commission? (How many sales reps?)
   - When is commission paid? (Monthly with invoice? Quarterly? Annual?)
   - Are there thresholds or caps? (e.g., "5% up to 25% GP, 7% above 25% GP"?)
   - Are there special rules or exceptions?

2. **Commission Plan B Details**
   - Name of Plan B?
   - Commission calculation formula?
   - Who receives this commission? (How many sales reps?)
   - When is commission paid?
   - Thresholds or caps?
   - Special rules or exceptions?

3. **Difference Analysis**
   - **Key Question**: What makes these two plans "convoluted"?
   - Is the complexity in the formula itself, or in the number of rules/exceptions?
   - Can both be expressed as variations of one base formula with different parameters?
   - Or are they fundamentally different calculations that require separate system logic?

4. **NetSuite Capability Assessment**
   - For simple commission plans (% of GP, tiered brackets): NetSuite standard functionality can handle
   - For complex plans (multiple conditions, unusual rules): May require custom script development
   - **Question**: Do both plans fall into "standard functionality" or will one/both need custom development?

**Decision Point**:
- Confirm both plan structures can be articulated clearly
- Identify if either plan requires custom development
- Assess feasibility in NetSuite

**Outcome**: Commission structure design session scheduled (if needed); custom development scope identified

---

#### **2C: Historical Account Cleanup - Inactive Accounts for Historical Data (10 minutes)**
**Facilitator**: Lorraine + Celine/Kevin  
**Decision Maker**: Lorraine  
**Business Impact**: Reporting accuracy, account management, compliance

**Background** (From your outstanding questions):
> *"How to handle inactive accounts needed for historical data but not for ongoing operations?"*

**Questions to Ask:**

1. **Current Historical Data Needs**
   - How far back do you need to run GL reports? (2017 baseline, but how frequently?)
   - Do users frequently run historical period-over-period reports? (e.g., Oct 2022 vs. Oct 2023?)
   - Which inactive accounts are critical for historical accuracy?
   - Are there accounts that haven't been used since 2015-2016?

2. **NetSuite Archive Options**
   - **Option A**: Keep all accounts active in NetSuite (searchable, available for historical GL)
   - **Option B**: Inactivate rarely-used accounts but keep them in GL records (can filter if needed)
   - **Option C**: Archive certain accounts completely (not available for new transactions)
   - **Question**: What's your preference? Do inactive accounts clutter the user experience?

3. **Cutoff Decision**
   - At what year can you mark an account as "retired"?
   - Example: Can accounts inactive since 2017 be archived? 2015? 2010?
   - Will archiving impact historical reporting capability?

4. **Implementation Detail**
   - Implementation team will handle archiving/inactivating accounts during migration planning
   - Just need your approval on the policy (archive or inactivate?)

**Decision Point**:
- Clarify archival/inactivation policy (Option A, B, or C?)
- Confirm cutoff date for archiving

**Outcome**: Policy documented for implementation team

---

#### **2D: Direct Bill Business - $1M Annually, Workflows & Commission Handling Not Detailed (11 minutes)**
**Facilitator**: Lorraine + Kipp + Matt (if available)  
**Decision Maker**: Lorraine/Matt  
**Business Impact**: Revenue accuracy, invoice processing, commission calculations

**Background** (From your outstanding questions):
> *"Direct Bill Business: $1M annually (1% of $100M revenue) - specific workflows and commission gross-up handling not detailed."*

**Questions to Ask:**

1. **What is "Direct Bill" Business?**
   - Are these pass-through costs + markup? (e.g., customer materials purchased on customer's behalf?)
   - Are these specialized services? (e.g., outside consulting, specialty labor?)
   - Are these drop-shipments? (Product shipped directly from vendor to customer, you invoice for it?)
   - **Core Question**: How does direct bill differ operationally from your normal project invoicing?

2. **Direct Bill Invoicing Workflow**
   - Step-by-step: How do these orders flow from quote → PO → Invoice?
   - Who creates the invoice? (Manually by AP? Automatically from order?)
   - What triggers the invoice? (Same as standard projects, or different event?)
   - How many direct bill invoices per month?

3. **Revenue Recognition**
   - When do you recognize revenue for direct bill? (Same timing as standard projects, or different?)
   - Is revenue the full invoice amount, or just your margin?

4. **Commission Impact**
   - Does the sales rep on the order get commission on direct bill business?
   - Commission on full invoice amount or just your margin?
   - **"Commission Gross-Up Handling"**: What does this mean?
     - Example: If customer negotiates discount on direct bill, does commission stay the same or reduce?
     - If there's a cost overrun, does commission increase?
     - Does NetSuite need special logic to handle commission on direct bill, or is it standard formula?

5. **System Design Question**
   - Can direct bill be handled as a standard project order type with different settings?
   - Or does it need separate GL accounts, revenue recognition rules, commission logic?

**Decision Point**:
- Clarify direct bill as distinct process or variation of standard process
- Identify any special commission handling required
- Confirm system design approach

**Outcome**: Direct bill business process documented for implementation design

### **SECTION 3: FINANCIAL SECURITY & PERMISSIONS - SCOPE DEFINITION (30 MINUTES)**

**Objective**: Define what "Financial Security & Permissions" means for your organization and scope the design work

**Note**: This was "not discussed in detail" in the original Friday session, so we're doing a scope-setting conversation, not detailed design.

**Facilitator**: Lorraine + Kipp  
**Decision Makers**: Lorraine (with input from Matt/Mark on role definitions)

---

#### **3A: Current State & Problem Statement (5 minutes)**

**Questions:**
1. Are there any permission/security issues in Core that you want to avoid in NetSuite?
2. Are there compliance or audit requirements for permission tracking? (Who changed what, when?)
3. Are there any roles/users that currently have inappropriate access?

**Expected Outcome**: Problem statement articulated (or confirmed as "no major issues")

---

#### **3B: Role Definition & GP Metric Visibility (15 minutes)**

**Background**: From prior discovery, there's a need for role-based visibility of two different GP metrics (Project GP vs. Commissionable GP).

**Questions:**

**1. Primary Roles & Users**
   - Define the main user roles in your organization:
     - **Sales Rep** (order entry, project visibility)
     - **Sales Manager** (team oversight, commission tracking)
     - **Finance/AP** (bill entry, approval, payments)
     - **GL/Accounting** (general ledger, period close, reporting)
     - **Executive** (dashboards, reporting, oversight)
     - **Other roles?**

**2. What Can Each Role See/Do?**

   For each role, answer:
   - Can create sales orders? (Yes/No)
   - Can view project profitability? (Yes/No - which metrics?)
   - Can view Commissionable GP? (Yes/No)
   - Can view Project GP? (Yes/No)
   - Can create journal entries? (Yes/No)
   - Can approve payments? (Yes/No)
   - Can export/download reports? (Yes/No)

   **Specific Question**: Can Sales Reps view commissionable GP (for understanding commission), but NOT see Project GP (which is higher margins for finance oversight)?

**3. Current Permission Gaps**
   - Sales team: Should they see full project profitability or just their sales commissions?
   - Finance team: Should AR/AP staff see executive summary reports?
   - Field team: Should they see project costs/budgets, or just assignments?
   - Anyone who should NOT see financial data but currently does in Core?

**Expected Outcome**: 
- ✅ Primary roles defined (4-6 roles)
- ✅ Matrix of who sees what metrics
- ✅ Any compliance requirements documented

---

#### **3C: Audit & Compliance Tracking (5 minutes)**

**Questions:**
1. Do you need audit trails? (Who changed what, when?)
2. Are there SOX or other compliance requirements?
3. Do you need to track and approve permission changes?

**Expected Outcome**: Audit requirement documented (or confirmed as standard NetSuite defaults sufficient)

---

#### **3D: Next Steps for Detailed Design (5 minutes)**

**Outcome**:
- ✅ Permission scope defined
- ✅ Detailed permission design session scheduled (can be async or short follow-up call with Lorraine + Kipp)
- ✅ Implementation team can draft permission matrix for review

---

## SESSION FACILITATION NOTES

### **Recommended Attendees**
- **Required**: Lorraine (CFO), Celine (GL), Kevin (GL), Kipp (Finance/IT expert)
- **Highly Recommended**: Marcus (Implementation) for COA design guidance and feasibility questions
- **Optional**: Matt/Mark (for commission plan and direct bill decisions - ideally join for Section 2B & 2D)

### **Facilitator Approach**
1. **Section 1 (COA)**: Collaborative design — go slow, ask clarifying questions, confirm decisions
2. **Section 2 (Quick Decisions)**: Move faster, capture key info, defer details to follow-up sessions
3. **Section 3 (Permissions)**: Scope-setting only — detailed design happens later

### **Contingency**
- If COA export not ready: Defer all COA discussion; reschedule for when data is available
- If Matt/Mark unavailable: Proceed with Lorraine on commission/direct bill decisions; loop Matt/Mark in for final approval later
- If session running long: Prioritize Sections 1 & 2A (COA & Invoice Triggers); defer Sections 2C, 2D, & 3 to follow-up calls
