|---------|-------|------|-------|-----------|
| **1A-1E** | **Chart of Accounts Design** | 90 min | Celine/Kevin + Lorraine | ✅ YES (4 decisions) |

- ✅ All attendees confirmed and calendar blocked

**If pre-work not complete**: RESCHEDULE — Session cannot proceed without COA data

---

## 4 CRITICAL COA DECISIONS (Section 1)

| Decision | Owner | Answer Format | Importance |
|----------|-------|---|---|
| **COA-1**: Target account count (range)? | Lorraine + GL team | Specific range (e.g., "250-350 accounts") | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| **COA-2**: Keep 15% markup as separate account or consolidate? | Lorraine | "Keep separate" OR "Consolidate" | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| **COA-3**: Segmentation strategy (accounts vs. classes/departments)? | Lorraine + Kipp | Preliminary guidance for impl team | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| **COA-4**: Account numbering scheme? | Celine/Kevin | Standard ranges (1000-1999 Assets, etc.) | 🟡 HIGH |

---

## 4 UNANSWERED QUESTIONS DECISIONS (Section 2)

| Question | Owner | Focus | Time Limit | Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Event-Based Invoice Triggers** | Lorraine | Define trigger events by order type | 12 min | List of events → Implementation |
| **Commission Plans** | Lorraine/Matt | Can two plans be supported? Custom dev needed? | 12 min | Feasibility + custom dev scope |
| **Historical Account Cleanup** | Lorraine | Archive or inactivate old accounts? | 10 min | Policy decision → Implementation |
| **Direct Bill Business** | Lorraine/Matt | Process flow & commission handling | 11 min | Process documented → Implementation |

**Note**: If running long, prioritize events & commission plans; defer others to follow-up

---

## PERMISSIONS SCOPE (Section 3)

**This is SCOPE-SETTING, not detailed design**

| Step | Topic | Owner | Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3A | Current state & problems | Lorraine | Problem statement (or "no major issues") |
| 3B | Role definitions | Lorraine + Kipp | List of roles + visibility matrix (preliminary) |
| 3C | Audit/compliance | Lorraine | Compliance requirements identified |
| 3D | Next steps | Facilitator | Follow-up design session scheduled |

---

## FACILITATION TIPS

### **Managing Time** (90 min COA section will feel tight)
- Use timer for each sub-section (COA-1A through 1E)
- If running 5-10 min over on usage analysis (1B), that's OK — that's the most valuable section
- If running over on COA-3 (target structure design), ask: "Do we have enough to move forward, or do we need another session?"
- Be prepared to defer detailed discussion of Sections 2C, 2D, 3 to follow-up calls

### **Getting Clear Answers**
- For COA: Ask for **specific numbers**, not ranges. "250? 300? 400?" — pick one range.
- For questions: Ask "Who decides this?" If answer is "Matt needs to decide," note that for follow-up.
- For permissions: Don't try to build complete matrix today. Get key roles identified (4-6 roles) and rough visibility rules.

### **Red Flags (Things That Stall Sessions)**
- 🚨 COA export not complete → Reschedule
- 🚨 Attendees don't know account usage patterns → Reschedule (need pre-work)
- 🚨 Spending >30 min on single question without reaching decision → Note for follow-up, move on
- 🚨 Matt/Mark not available and needed for decision → Note decision pending, continue with Lorraine, confirm later

### **Documentation During Session**
- Keep running list of decisions (4 COA decisions + 4 questions)
- For each decision, note: **Decision Made** | **Owner** | **Rationale** | **Implementation Impact**
- Flag any that need follow-up or higher approval

---

## AFTER THE SESSION (Next 24 Hours)

### **Immediate Actions**
1. **Document all decisions** in session notes (use Decision Matrix from agenda)
2. **Send notes to attendees** for confirmation (email format below)
3. **Flag any pending decisions** (e.g., "Awaiting Matt/Mark approval on commission complexity")
4. **Identify follow-up needs** (e.g., "Need follow-up call on period close if not addressed today")

---

## IMPLEMENTATION TEAM PARALLEL WORK (Don't Wait for Perfection)

**Start Immediately After Nov 6 Session:**
1. Create COA mapping document (old → new accounts) based on decisions
2. Document revenue recognition rules from Nov 6 clarification
3. Document invoice trigger events
4. Document direct bill workflow
5. Begin commission plan analysis

**While F-1 to F-4 Sessions Are Occurring:**
- Continue detailed requirements gathering
- Prepare design specs for ACCOMMODATE items

---

## RED FLAGS & ESCALATION

| Red Flag | Action |
|---|---|
| COA decision cannot be made today | → Schedule follow-up with Lorraine + Celine/Kevin only (shorter meeting) |
| Matt/Mark unavailable for commission/15% markup | → Document Lorraine's recommendation; schedule 15-min confirmation call with Matt/Mark |
| Scope creeping (too many questions arising) | → Note for follow-up; stay focused on current session |
| Attendees getting fatigued (hitting 2h 30m mark) | → Wrap up cleanly; schedule follow-up for remaining items |
| No clear answer emerging for a decision | → Note as "pending clarification" — move on, don't burn time |

---

## REALISTIC OUTCOME EXPECTATIONS

### **What You WILL Get**
✅ Preliminary COA structure with target account count  
✅ Clarity on 4 unanswered questions (or note which need follow-up)  
✅ Permission scope defined (primary roles identified)  
✅ Clear list of implementation team action items  
✅ Follow-up sessions scheduled  

### **What You WON'T Get** (And That's OK)
❌ Complete detailed COA mapping (implementation team does that)  
❌ Detailed revenue recognition rules by order type (may need follow-up)  
❌ Final commission structure design (may need F-5 deep dive)  
❌ Completed permission matrix (design phase work)  
❌ All outstanding questions answered (prioritize top 4, defer others)
