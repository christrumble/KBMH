4. Determine level of detail needed (department-level? project-level? activity-based?)

#### **Session Agenda (75 minutes)**

```
TIME        | TOPIC
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
0:00-0:15   | Current forecasting process deep dive
0:15-0:30   | Forecast requirements (timing, frequency, granularity)
0:30-0:45   | What data drives forecasts? (Pipeline? Backlog? Historical trends?)
0:45-1:00   | NetSuite Planning module vs. dashboard approach
1:00-1:10   | Phase 1 vs. Phase 2 decision
1:10-1:15   | Next steps
```

#### **Critical Questions**

   - Lorraine's reference to "backlog for forecasting" — clarify what this is:
     - Is it a tool/platform? (Project management? Spreadsheet?)
     - Is it a process? (Manual review of pipeline?)
     - Is it data? (Sales backlog of projects?)
   - Walk through current forecast workflow:
     - Who inputs forecast data?
     - When? (Monthly? Quarterly?)
     - What data is used to build forecast? (Historical? Pipeline? Orders?)
     - Who uses the forecast? (Lorraine? Team? Board?)
     - How is it used? (Cash planning? Headcount planning? Procurement planning?)

**2. Forecast Outputs — What Do You Need?**
   - Revenue forecast (monthly/quarterly/annual)?
   - Gross profit forecast?
   - Cash flow forecast (separate from GL cash management)?
   - Expense forecast (payroll, G&A)?
   - What time horizon? (Next 12 months? 3 years?)
   - What granularity? (Company-wide? By division (KB/Hoag)? By project? By customer?)

**3. Forecast Methodology**
   - Current approach: Bottom-up (project-level) or top-down (company-level)?
   - Based on: Historical trends? Pipeline? Orders? Manager input?
   - Accuracy requirement: How close must forecast match actual? (±5%? ±10%?)
   - Frequency of re-forecast: Monthly? Quarterly?
   - Comparison: Forecast vs. Actual reports required?

**4. Phase 1 vs. Phase 2 Scope**
   - **Phase 1**: Is forecasting critical for go-live? (Recommended NO unless revenue-critical)
   - **Phase 2**: Should forecasting be addressed after core financial systems stable?
   - **Question**: Would you rather have core GL/AP/AR working perfectly in Phase 1, or have forecasting in Phase 1 with less perfect core systems?

**5. NetSuite Planning Module Evaluation**
   - **Planning Module (NetSuite product)**: Advanced budgeting/forecasting with automation
     - Additional cost: ~$15-20K per year
     - Complexity: Requires data model design, setup
     - Timeline: 6-8 weeks to implement
   - **Alternative - Dashboard Approach**: Use NetSuite dashboards + saved searches to show forecast opportunity
     - Cost: Included in standard NetSuite
     - Complexity: Lower
     - Timeline: 2-3 weeks to implement
   - **Question**: Which approach fits your needs?

#### **Decision Point**
- ✅ **DECISION**: Is forecasting Phase 1 or Phase 2 requirement?
- ✅ If Phase 1: Planning module or dashboard approach?
- ✅ Forecast requirements defined (outputs, granularity, methodology)

#### **Outcome**
- Forecasting scope and timeline confirmed
- If Phase 1: Implementation team can begin design
- If Phase 2: Requirement documented for later phases
- Storage Fee Billing & Variance Investigation can be addressed in this session or separately
