CRITICAL PRE-WORK (MUST COMPLETE BEFORE SESSION STARTS)
================================================================================

⚠️ IF THIS ISN'T DONE, SESSION CANNOT PROCEED:

□ Celine/Kevin: Export COMPLETE Core chart of accounts
  - Need: Account numbers, descriptions, types, usage frequency
  - Why: Core for entire discussion
  
□ Pre-identify top 50 most-used accounts
  - Why: Key data for session analysis
  
□ Pre-identify obvious duplicate accounts  
  - Why: Foundation for consolidation discussion

□ Confirm all attendees can commit to 2h 45m (no interruptions)
  - Why: Session requires focused time; can't be fragmented
  
□ Send Session_Agenda_WorkingSession_Nov6.md to attendees 24hrs before
  - Why: People prepare mentally and can gather their thoughts

================================================================================
DECISION POINTS TODAY
================================================================================

CHART OF ACCOUNTS (4 decisions):
1. Target account count range (e.g., 250-350? 300-400?)
2. Keep 15% markup as separate account OR consolidate it?
3. Segmentation strategy (how many accounts vs. classes/departments)?
4. Account numbering scheme (standard ranges or current scheme)?

UNANSWERED QUESTIONS (4 decisions):
5. Invoice trigger events by order type (when invoice generates?)
6. Commission plans - can both be supported? Custom dev needed?
7. Historical account cleanup policy (archive or inactivate old accounts?)
8. Direct bill business workflow & commission handling?

PERMISSIONS FRAMEWORK (preliminary):
9. Define primary user roles (4-6 roles)
10. Define GP visibility by role (who sees Project GP vs. Commissionable GP?)

KEY CONTACTS & QUESTIONS
================================================================================

→ See Session_Agenda_WorkingSession_Nov6.md (detailed Q's by section)

For quick reference during session:
→ See PM_QuickReference_SessionPlanning.md (print this!)

For follow-up session planning:

For proving all topics are covered:
→ See Mapping_OriginalOutline_to_Sessions.md

For leadership briefing:

For implementation team action items:

================================================================================
FINAL NOTE
================================================================================

This session plan accomplishes what was requested: identifying good topics 
and providing specific questions to ask. 

However, it also recognizes that your PM's original outline covers ~15 topics 
that genuinely cannot be adequately handled in a single session without 
sacrificing decision quality.

The recommended approach:
• TODAY: Focused 2h 45m session on COA + critical decisions
• NEXT 4 WEEKS: 5-6 dedicated sessions on remaining topics
• MID-DECEMBER: All discovery complete, ready for implementation

This ensures:
✅ Quality decisions (not rushed)
✅ Full topic coverage (nothing skipped)
✅ Clear action items (implementation team knows what to do)
✅ Stakeholder alignment (all voices heard)
✅ Ready for configuration (complete BRD by Dec 13)

Good luck with today's session!
