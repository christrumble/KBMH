## Implementation Approach Classifications

**ALIGNS**: The way the dealer is executing a business process in their current business system aligns with how they will do it in Orion. It might not be an exact one-to-one alignment, but it doesn't require any customizations for them to do what they are currently doing now in Orion.

**ADAPT**: They do need to modify their business process to use Orion. Adaptation is on a spectrum so it could be major or minor - but still no customization required.

**ACCOMMODATE**: WE will accommodate their business process by customization, personalization, new configuration - something we need to do to accommodate their needs.
