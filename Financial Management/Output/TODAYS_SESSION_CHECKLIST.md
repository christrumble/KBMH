- [ ] Review COA export quality with Celine/Kevin
- [ ] Confirm data completeness (usage frequency present? Yes/No)
- [ ] If incomplete → PAUSE SESSION, reschedule
- [ ] If complete → Proceed with 1B

**Time Check**: 00:05 elapsed ✓

### **1B: Usage Analysis (25 minutes)**
*Facilitator: Celine/Kevin + Lorraine*

**Key Questions to Ask** (ask verbally, track answers):
- [ ] How many accounts appear on typical monthly trial balance?
- [ ] How many accounts have >100 transactions per year?
- [ ] How many accounts have <5-10 transactions per year?
- [ ] Define threshold: What's "most-used" vs. "rarely-used"?
- [ ] Does account usage vary significantly by month?
- [ ] Any accounts used only during period close?
- [ ] Any accounts used only annually?
- [ ] Are there location-specific accounts (KB vs. Hoag differences)?

**Track**: Record answers in notebook; update Decision Matrix as patterns emerge

**Decision Point**: Usage patterns clearly understood? YES / NO / NEEDS CLARIFICATION

**If Running Late**: Skip detailed patterns discussion; move to "top 50 most-used identified? Yes/No"

**Time Check**: 00:30 elapsed ✓

### **1C: Duplicate & Redundant Accounts (15 minutes)**
*Facilitator: Celine/Kevin + Lorraine*

- [ ] Tier 4 (Keep separate - regulatory/audit)

**Decision Point**: Consolidation strategy clear? YES / NO / FOLLOW-UP NEEDED

**If Running Late**: Prioritize Tier 1 and Tier 2; note Tier 3&4 for follow-up session

**Time Check**: 00:45 elapsed ✓

### **1D: Target COA Structure & Design Philosophy (40 minutes)**
*Facilitator: Lorraine + Marcus*

**This is the longest section - go slowly, build consensus**

#### **Part 1: Root Cause Analysis (5 min)**
- [ ] Ask: "What's causing the 40+ page expansion?"
  - Too many specific accounts?
  - Lack of consolidation/segmentation?
  - Different divisions each have own accounts?
  - Historical accounts never cleaned up?

#### **Part 2: Target Structure & Numbers (10 min)**
- [ ] **DECISION POINT #1**: Target account count?
  - Conservative (250-300)? / Moderate (300-400)? / Flexible (400-500)?
  - Get Lorraine to commit to a specific RANGE
  - **Document exact range in Decision Matrix**

#### **Part 3: Segmentation Strategy (10 min)**
- [ ] Ask: "Instead of 500 accounts, could we use fewer accounts + heavy Classes/Departments?"

- [ ] **DECISION POINT #2**: Accounts vs. segmentation balance?
- [ ] **Document approach in Decision Matrix**

#### **Part 4: Account Categories (10 min)**
*For each category, ask:*
- [ ] **Revenue**: How many distinct types needed?
- [ ] **COGS**: One account + project coding, or separate by cost type?
- [ ] **G&A Expenses**: How many categories truly needed?
- [ ] **Equity/FA**: Special tracking needs?

- [ ] 15% Labor Markup impact:
  - [ ] **DECISION POINT #3**: Keep as separate account or consolidate?
  - [ ] **Document in Decision Matrix**

#### **Part 5: Account Numbering Scheme (5 min)**
- [ ] Current scheme: (Ask what it is)
- [ ] Proposed scheme: Standard ranges (1000-1999 Assets, etc.)?

## RED FLAGS - IF THESE HAPPEN, ESCALATE

🚨 **COA export not available**
- Action: STOP session, reschedule
- Timeline: Cannot proceed without this data

🚨 **Attendees don't know account usage patterns**
- Action: STOP section, reschedule
- Reason: Pre-work was not completed

🚨 **No decision reached after 30 minutes on one question**
- Action: NOTE FOR FOLLOW-UP, MOVE ON
- Don't burn time trying to force a decision

🚨 **Matt/Mark unavailable for question 2B/2D (commission, direct bill)**
- Action: Get Lorraine's recommendation, LOOP MATT/MARK IN LATER for approval
- Don't delay entire session

🚨 **Permissions discussion is getting too detailed**
- Action: REMIND: This is SCOPE-SETTING, not detailed design
- Say: "We'll design the detailed matrix in follow-up phase"

🚨 **Running significantly behind (>10 min late by 02:00 mark)**
- Action: ACCELERATE through remaining sections
- Prioritize COA (most important), defer permissions details to follow-up call

---

## SUCCESS CRITERIA - Session is Successful If:

✅ **COA target account count finalized** (specific number or range committed)  
✅ **All 4 COA decisions documented** (4/4)  
✅ **All 4 unanswered questions addressed** (4/4)  
✅ **Permissions framework scoped** (roles identified, visibility matrix drafted)  
✅ **All decisions documented and sent to attendees** (within 2 hours of session end)  
✅ **Implementation team knows what to do next** (action items clear)  
✅ **Follow-up sessions scheduled** (F-1 through F-4 dates locked)  

---

## FACILITATION TIPS

**Keeping Pace:**
- Use timer visible on screen
- Allocate time strictly: 90 (COA) + 45 (Q's) + 30 (Perms)
- If running over in Section 1, trim Section 3 (can be follow-up call)

**Getting Clear Answers:**
- Ask for SPECIFIC numbers, not ranges
- Repeat back to confirm: "So you're saying...?"
- If unclear, note "CLARIFY IN FOLLOW-UP" — don't spend 20 min debating

**Building Consensus:**
- Invite input from all attendees, not just Lorraine
- Celine/Kevin: "Do you agree with that?" 
- Kipp: "Does that make sense financially?"

**Keeping Energy:**
- Halfway through (01:22 mark), consider 2-min break
- Keep tone positive and moving forward
- Celebrate when decisions are made: "Great, we've got that one!"

---

## FINAL REMINDERS

- **Print PM_QuickReference_SessionPlanning.md BEFORE session**
- **Have timer visible during session**
- **Update Decision Matrix in real-time (don't wait until end)**
- **Don't go over on any section — it cascades**
- **Recap all decisions at very end**
- **Send decision email SAME DAY (within 2 hours)**
- **Follow up with implementation team for action items**
