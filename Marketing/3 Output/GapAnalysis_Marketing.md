## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Marketing discovery questionnaire is **87% complete** with strong evidence quality for answered questions (confidence ratings 85-95%). Critical information gaps exist primarily in **configuration-level detail** rather than strategic understanding. The team has excellent clarity on their unique relationship-based marketing model, RFP coordination approach, and minimal campaign usage strategy. However, **5 high-priority workshops and deliverables** are needed before configuration can begin, focusing on taxonomy definitions, data validation rules, and technical specifications.

**Critical Gaps**: Contact role taxonomy, sector classifications, RFP workflow specifications, market intelligence dashboard requirements, and data validation rule definitions.

**Follow-up Sessions Needed**: 3-4 targeted workshops (90-120 minutes each) over next 3-4 weeks.

**Estimated Timeline**: 3-4 weeks to achieve 100% questionnaire completion and readiness for configuration phase.

- **Probability**: MEDIUM (30-40%) - Common challenge in implementations requiring data discipline
- **Severity**: CRITICAL - Core Phase 1 marketing value unrealized
- **Mitigation Strategy**:
  1. Make taxonomy simple and clear (limit options, clear definitions)
  2. Required fields with good error messages (not just "field required")
  3. Sales leadership buy-in and enforcement
  4. Regular data quality reports showing gaps
  5. Recognition/rewards for good data practices
  6. Training emphasis on "why" not just "how"
  7. Quick wins showing segmentation value early
- **Owner**: Change Management Lead + Sales Leadership

- **Severity**: HIGH - Critical process, visible failure
- **Mitigation Strategy**:
  1. Extensive BD team involvement in workflow design (Session 2)
  2. Pilot/testing with real RFPs before go-live
  3. Parallel run for 2 weeks if needed
  4. Quick iteration based on early feedback
  5. Training on new workflow benefits (not just features)
  6. Executive mandate on Asana retirement (if needed)
  7. Marketing PM as champion and early adopter
- **Owner**: Marketing PM + Implementation Lead

**RISK-M003: Dashboard Doesn't Deliver Value**
- **Description**: Market intelligence dashboard built but not used or useful
- **Impact**: Core Phase 1 benefit unrealized; marketing team dissatisfaction; ROI questioned
- **Probability**: MEDIUM (25-35%) - Dashboard requirements often miss the mark initially
- **Severity**: HIGH - Major value proposition for marketing

  3. Pilot dashboard before full build
  4. Training on how to use insights for decisions
  5. Regular review cadence (weekly at first)
  6. Quick iteration post-launch (30-day refinement)
  7. Tie dashboard insights to tangible actions/wins

  3. Third-party data enrichment if needed (sector, role, etc.)
  4. Phased approach: Start with high-value contacts (top clients, influencers)
  5. Accept that some data will remain incomplete initially
  6. Ongoing cleansing post-launch (not one-time project)
  7. Validation rules prevent new bad data
- **Owner**: Data Migration Lead + Marketing Team

- **Impact**: Restricted permissions; marketing visibility limited; market intelligence compromised
- **Probability**: LOW-MEDIUM (20-30%) - Cultural/political issue
- **Severity**: MEDIUM - Limits value but workarounds possible
- **Mitigation Strategy**:
  1. Sales leadership buy-in on marketing visibility rationale
  2. Clear permission boundaries (what marketing can/can't see)
  3. Emphasize marketing support role (not oversight)
  4. Demonstrate value of proactive marketing support
  5. Privacy controls for sensitive deals (if needed)
- **Owner**: Sales Leadership + Marketing PM

**RISK-M006: Email Template Migration Incomplete**
- **Description**: NetSuite email templates don't match MailChimp quality; team keeps using MailChimp
- **Impact**: Dual system continues; training wasted; adoption failure
- **Probability**: LOW-MEDIUM (20-30%) - Low campaign volume reduces urgency
- **Severity**: MEDIUM - Important but low immediate impact
- **Mitigation Strategy**:
  1. Template migration as Phase 2 refinement (not blocking)
  2. Focus on 1-2 most critical templates initially
  3. Training on Google Slides ‚Üí NetSuite workflow
  4. Accept that first campaigns may be simpler
  5. Iterate templates based on actual campaign needs post-launch
- **Owner**: Marketing Team + Training Lead

**RISK-M007: Workshop Fatigue/Scheduling Delays**
- **Description**: Difficulty scheduling all stakeholders; sessions drag out; delays configuration start
- **Impact**: Timeline extends; momentum lost; go-live date at risk
- **Probability**: MEDIUM (30-40%) - Always a challenge with multiple busy stakeholders
- **Severity**: MEDIUM - Delays project but not fatal
- **Mitigation Strategy**:
  1. Schedule all 4 sessions upfront (get calendar holds)
  2. Executive sponsor communicates priority
  3. Efficient facilitation (stick to agenda and time limits)
  4. Pre-work distributed early and emphasized
  5. Backup session dates identified upfront
  6. Core critical attendees vs. optional attendees clearly defined

### LOW RISK - Accept and Monitor

**RISK-M008: Campaign Volume Remains Low**
- **Description**: Email campaign capability built but used <6 times/year as currently; underutilization
- **Impact**: Low ROI on email marketing investment; capabilities unused
- **Probability**: MEDIUM-HIGH (60-70%) - Expected based on current strategy
- **Severity**: LOW - Aligns with stated strategy; not a failure
- **Mitigation**: 
  1. Minimal investment in email setup (don't over-build)
  2. Capability available when/if needs grow
  3. No custom development for campaigns initially
  4. Post-launch evaluation of adoption and value
- **Owner**: Marketing Team

**RISK-M009: Event Management Remains Unused**
- **Description**: Event tracking not adopted; team continues personal invites and Google Forms
- **Impact**: Event capabilities unused; no ROI improvement
- **Probability**: HIGH (70-80%) - Expected based on current approach
- **Severity**: LOW - Acknowledged as future phase; not a Phase 1 goal
- **Mitigation**: 
  1. Minimal event setup in Phase 1 (just awareness)
  2. Formal evaluation at 6 months (already planned)
  3. No training time allocated to event features
  4. Accept current process will continue short-term
- **Owner**: Marketing Team

## DECISION LOG UPDATES

### Decisions Made During Gap Analysis

**DECISION-M026: Phased Approach to Questionnaire Completion**
- **Decision**: Complete questionnaire through targeted workshops vs. additional discovery interviews
- **Rationale**: High-confidence answers exist for strategic questions; gaps are primarily configuration details best resolved in workshop format
- **Impact**: REQ-M004, REQ-M005, REQ-M006, REQ-M007, REQ-M008, REQ-M016, REQ-M017, REQ-M019, REQ-M020
- **Approach**: ACCOMMODATE (workshops are customized for KBM Hoag's needs)

**DECISION-M027: Contact Segmentation as Highest Priority**
- **Decision**: Taxonomy workshop (Session 1) is first and most critical session
- **Rationale**: Foundation for all other marketing capabilities; blocks configuration without it
- **Impact**: All segmentation-related requirements (REQ-M004, REQ-M006, REQ-M007, REQ-M008)
- **Approach**: ACCOMMODATE (custom taxonomy required)

**DECISION-M028: RFP Workflow Must Work at Go-Live**
- **Decision**: RFP workflow (Session 2) is must-have for go-live; no parallel Asana run
- **Rationale**: Dual systems create confusion and defeat purpose; team consensus needed
- **Impact**: REQ-M016, REQ-M017
- **Approach**: ACCOMMODATE (custom workflow to replace Asana)

**DECISION-M029: Data Quality Through Validation, Not Training Alone**
- **Decision**: Implement required fields and validation rules, not just training on best practices
- **Rationale**: "Poo in, poo out" problem requires system enforcement, not just user goodwill
- **Impact**: REQ-M005
- **Approach**: ACCOMMODATE (custom validation rules)

**DECISION-M030: Dashboard Iteration Post-Launch**
- **Decision**: Build dashboard to 80% confidence; expect refinement within 30 days of go-live
- **Rationale**: Dashboard requirements often evolve with actual usage; perfect upfront design unlikely
- **Impact**: REQ-M019, REQ-M020, REQ-M021
- **Approach**: ACCOMMODATE (custom dashboard with planned iteration)

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Critical Success Factors

1. **Executive Sponsorship**: Sales leadership must mandate contact classification discipline; marketing alone can't enforce
2. **Workshop Efficiency**: 4-5 sessions in 3-4 weeks is aggressive; requires disciplined facilitation and pre-work completion
3. **Realistic Expectations**: First campaigns and dashboards will be learning experiences; iterate, don't seek perfection
4. **Data Migration Reality**: Contact cleansing will take longer than expected; phase it and prioritize high-value contacts
5. **Change Champions**: Identify Marketing PM and 1-2 BD reps as champions to drive adoption

### Implementation Recommendations

**Phase 1 Focus** (Must-Have for Go-Live):
1. ‚úÖ Contact segmentation foundation (taxonomy, fields, validation)
2. ‚úÖ RFP workflow to replace Asana (fully functional)
3. ‚úÖ Market intelligence dashboard v1.0 (basic, iterate post-launch)
4. ‚úÖ Web-to-lead form integration (standard functionality)
5. ‚úÖ Basic email campaign capability (available but not heavily invested)

**Phase 1 Defer** (Post-Launch Refinement):
6. üîÑ Email template sophistication (start simple, iterate)
7. üîÑ Event management (evaluate at 6 months)
8. üîÑ Customer satisfaction surveys (evaluate at 6+ months)
9. üîÑ Influencer ROI methodology (develop when data available)
10. üîÑ Campaign ROI attribution (Phase 2 sophistication)

**Phase 2 Considerations** (6-12 Months Post-Launch):
11. üöÄ Advanced market intelligence (predictive analytics, AI insights)
12. üöÄ Automated lead nurturing (if lead volume increases)
13. üöÄ Event management implementation (if ROI justified)
14. üöÄ Survey automation and integration
15. üöÄ Campaign sophistication (A/B testing, advanced personalization)

### Data Migration Approach

**High-Priority Contacts** (Classify First):
- Active clients (current projects)
- Top 50 influencers (brokers, A&D, PMs)
- Active opportunities
- Recent leads (last 6 months)

**Medium-Priority Contacts** (Classify Second):
- Past clients (last 3 years)
- All identified influencers
- Prospects in pipeline
- Vendor contacts

**Low-Priority Contacts** (Classify Over Time):
- Inactive contacts (no activity > 3 years)
- Unsubscribed marketing contacts
- Low-value historical data

**Accept Reality**:
- Some contacts will remain unclassified at go-live
- Ongoing classification as contacts become active
- Annual data quality reviews and cleanup
- Validation rules prevent NEW bad data (key)
