00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:11.580
Jill Marsh: Hello.

2
00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:13.069
Alex Blangeres: How you doing?

3
00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:19.870
Jill Marsh: I'm good. I'm just getting ready to get in the car, and I was like, well, I can listen to this while I'm driving.

4
00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:20.580
Alex Blangeres: Yeah.

5
00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:22.490
Alex Blangeres: Oh, good.

6
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:25.690
Alex Blangeres: Oh, man.

7
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:32.139
Jill Marsh: I know, I'm like, all the things going on. And then, I might have jury duty tomorrow…

8
00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.860
Alex Blangeres: Oh my god, Jill!

9
00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.780
Jill Marsh: So, I'll find out tonight.

10
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.210
Alex Blangeres: What the heck?

11
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.490
Jill Marsh: I know.

12
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.469
Alex Blangeres: I know no one else is on, but you should hear pretty quickly, right?

13
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:52.059
Jill Marsh: I think so, and it's like, it might just be that it's there, and that's fine, and whatever.

14
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.840
Jill Marsh: But also, eventually, if it's, like, gets too large, it can push on your optic nerve.

15
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.630
Alex Blangeres: So it's like, then you just have to, like, monitor it throughout time, but…

16
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:12.480
Jill Marsh: It's clearly throwing off, my blood work, like, there's something throwing off my blood work, because my,

17
00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.880
Jill Marsh: Prolactin is, like, ex… anyway, it's off.

18
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.369
Cornerstone: Alright, on the phone we have Alex and Jill.

19
00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:37.060
Cornerstone: I will…

20
00:01:37.068 --> 00:01:49.518
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): I will tell you, from being on Zoom earlier today, anyone who's sitting over here, I don't know, it doesn't pick up very good sound in this room when you're remote. Just FYI. Okay. We had a really hard time listen… I had a hard time with people.

21
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.690
Alex Blangeres: I did too. Yeah, Kimmy was talking a couple times, yeah. But we can hear you perfectly right now.

22
00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.420
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): That's because I'm loud.

23
00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:08.970
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Yeah, I think the… he has to enunciate, because the microphones are up on the ceiling. Oh, I see. Because they didn't want any blemishes on the table. That's correct.

24
00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:13.330
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Gotcha. Well, then speak loudly.

25
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.540
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Okay.

26
00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.699
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): We'll run it when you are. I'm so close. Okay! I'm okay.

27
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:23.450
Cornerstone: for cells.

28
00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:31.689
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): I took a melatonin last night, and I actually slept through the night, so that was… Oh, I have to reshare, though. You have to reshare.

29
00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.810
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Yeah, Matt, if you want to introduce, that'd be great. Alright, so this session…

30
00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.670
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): It's all about…

31
00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:56.019
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): free and front, I think I'm getting there in time to look at what it's called. Marketing. Marketing and Lead Management. So, it's going to be on the technical side of marketing and lead management. Let's remember that for our

32
00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:06.560
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): creatives in the room. And we'll go through the questions based off of what's working, what's not working, around our CRM, and…

33
00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:13.419
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And, like, front-end work that we're doing before we get to a quote or proposal, or even an RFP standpoint.

34
00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.120
Alex Blangeres: Matt, just a reminder to hit record.

35
00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.299
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yes, I'm recording.

36
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.390
Alex Blangeres: Oh, sorry, you didn't see that.

37
00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:27.470
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I set up everything. You see the sharing key up there? Sorry. GRS.

38
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:40.290
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Or do you need the meeting ID? What's the best? Meeting ID is… 981… 3857?

39
00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.520
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): 6344.

40
00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.030
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Oh, and then I have to let you… oh.

41
00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.379
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Alex, Jill, can you let Marcus in? I'm not logged in on my…

42
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.599
Alex Blangeres: I just admitted, yeah.

43
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:03.659
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Perfect, thank you.

44
00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:13.989
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Marcus, what's the ethnicity on your last name? That's very unique. Oh, it's Italian. That's Italian? I never would have guessed that.

45
00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.209
Cornerstone: Turn out some.

46
00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:20.740
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): From the water, is what it means.

47
00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.829
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I'm almost there. I'm sorry, guys. I'm not a Zoom person. It's okay, we're used to this.

48
00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.250
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): We do the same thing on Teams.

49
00:04:34.255 --> 00:04:39.104
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Marcus was telling me we're the first dealer he's working with that isn't on Teams.

50
00:04:39.565 --> 00:04:41.944
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yeah, because we… we used to be…

51
00:04:42.185 --> 00:04:49.324
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): on Zoom, well, it was RingCentral, right? And then we switched to Teams, because all they did was run on Teams, so…

52
00:04:51.095 --> 00:04:56.624
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I told him that there would be mute me if I tried to do all the teams.

53
00:04:57.735 --> 00:05:00.675
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): You guys are all being so patient, thank you. There we go.

54
00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.340
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Marketing and lead acquisition.

55
00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.659
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): That's where we're at. Is there anybody new in this?

56
00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.940
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): No, everybody's… everybody's been here before. Okay.

57
00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:22.800
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Okay, so we start… we kind of have that two-step process, right? We start really with, here's a quick overview of what's available to you inside of NetSuite and Orion from a functionality standpoint.

58
00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:38.470
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): And then we do our analysis, where we ask you a ton of questions about how you do marketing. I already learned a little bit today, the way that you do marketing is kind of unique, because, your marketing department is actually doing, like, some sales process, really, right? Because you're doing RFPs. Yeah.

59
00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:47.500
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): So that's interesting, and so we'll talk a little about that. But from a NetSuite Orion perspective, you have email marketing capabilities inside of the system.

60
00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:57.010
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): I think you guys are using MailChimp currently. NetSuite, I feel NetSuite is a great regional marketing solution, because you get 120,000 emails a month.

61
00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.409
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Way more than we would ever use. Yeah, yeah.

62
00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:08.050
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): And, you have email marketing campaigns that you can use to manage all of that, report out on it.

63
00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.580
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Lead capture and management, so…

64
00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:25.610
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): We also have a feature in there where, like, you probably have a contact us form on your site. Well, that can actually be our form embedded in your site, and if somebody fills it out, it creates a lead inside of NetStream, then that can be routed to anybody and managed.

65
00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:33.020
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Once you have your… Either leads or contacts in the system, they can be segmented and targeted.

66
00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:42.740
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): We have duplicate detection and management, which is really important for a database. I don't know if you have that feature in Core or not, but,

67
00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:45.859
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): NetSuite, by default, does a good job of this, but…

68
00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:55.260
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): What we've also noticed is that, we've been able to leverage AI to help us even get a little bit better, targeting of potential duplicates in the system.

69
00:06:55.430 --> 00:07:02.259
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): And then, as always, reporting and analytics right inside the Nestu platform, including dashboards with KPIs and things like that.

70
00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:12.260
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): So that's how we traditionally look at marketing, but you guys do it a little bit different, because you're doing RFPs, and actually doing, like, some… but I would think

71
00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:15.870
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): be considered, really, conversion, too, right? I mean, you're actually…

72
00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:26.270
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): identifying, targeting, and then managing these RFPs, eventually converting. So, let me jump into… But here's a typical…

73
00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:35.550
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Not necessarily typical for you, but web form, lead creation, qualification, assigning to a rep, or BD rep.

74
00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:39.469
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Do you have the concept of business development reps? Yes.

75
00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:42.719
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): And are they doing…

76
00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:51.360
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): What are they doing? Lead creation. Great question. I'll let, Chill and Kate and Alex speak to that.

77
00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:55.530
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): What have you picked? What are your three reps, Dewey versus an account manager?

78
00:07:55.880 --> 00:08:01.180
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): They're out in the market, more customer-facing, out, you know.

79
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:07.940
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Wining, dining, taking out influencers, brokers, clients, building relationships.

80
00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:15.900
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Our account management is more, like, it gets oftentimes passed off. Sometimes the account managers are also

81
00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:21.700
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Getting their own leads, but, they're really then the one who manages

82
00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:28.710
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): everything surrounding the project. Okay. The different players, after… Project manager, basically. Yeah.

83
00:08:28.985 --> 00:08:34.555
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Got it. Depends on which account manager. There's some that mimic closer to business development, there's some that…

84
00:08:35.645 --> 00:08:39.594
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): A bit closer to sales support, like, it just depends.

85
00:08:39.755 --> 00:08:44.744
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): It's pretty… Kimmy, would you say we'd leave it broad on purpose? Like… I… I would.

86
00:08:44.745 --> 00:08:50.585
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): part of the incentive or comp for an account manager, but we have to have a certain skill set. Yep.

87
00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:51.920
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Got it.

88
00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:53.250
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): on your…

89
00:08:53.255 --> 00:08:56.534
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Sorry, flow. That's basically what our flow is now.

90
00:08:56.995 --> 00:09:00.274
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): But the… goes web form, lead creation.

91
00:09:00.515 --> 00:09:16.234
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): which comes to me, which then I qualify, and then I give it to one of the GMs, or I, if it's an existing client, give it to that person. But most of the time, it's people asking if they can give us a cleaning quote, which then I delete.

92
00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:21.209
Jill Marsh: For the most part, the web form stuff is, like, it's usually not…

93
00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:28.870
Jill Marsh: It's like a one-off, like, hi, we just need this one small little thing, so not a ton of, like, actual…

94
00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:30.899
Jill Marsh: I don't want sick or not.

95
00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:43.719
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I did get one last week that was an existing client that just wrote cubicles. And I sent it to Chris, and it resulted in an order for Sunlight Touchdown Cubicles, so… Wow!

96
00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.679
Jill Marsh: We'll take more of those.

97
00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:56.300
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): It's important to have, but it's a lot of cleaning quotes, or I… I inherited my grandmother's Noel Eames chair, and I need a pad for it. I'm like, no, like…

98
00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:57.600
Jill Marsh: That's right.

99
00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:13.430
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): So, our approach, or our framework for today, is we start asking you questions about your current state, how you guys are doing things now, your overall objectives as it relates to marketing, any requirements functional, and then any requirements technical.

100
00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:23.299
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): And so let's just talk a little bit more about your current state and how you're doing things. And let's talk about all the inputs first for our potential needs.

101
00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:27.430
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): We just mentioned one, the contact us form is one.

102
00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.100
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Rfps would be another.

103
00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:36.480
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): I imagine influencers is probably your primary one, right? You're probably getting leads from your influencers? Yes.

104
00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:41.320
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Most of those are managed by our business development team.

105
00:10:41.325 --> 00:10:47.344
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): the general managers, like, their relationships. So they're the owners of all of that.

106
00:10:47.345 --> 00:11:06.534
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): an RFP will come in through one of them. It's not like it just comes to QVM Hope. Yeah, very rarely. It comes in through a relationship that's already been established with an outside project management firm, or an architecture and design firm, or a client that's helped. Maybe we've got a nice relationship with them.

107
00:11:07.295 --> 00:11:09.514
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Sometimes the manufacturer. Manual process.

108
00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:20.789
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yep. So the salespeople are putting in, if they choose to, they're not required to, putting in opportunities and then assigning a value, a probability to them.

109
00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:25.939
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And then it may get converted from there.

110
00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:38.789
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And the converted process right now is it stays at Zendesk. If they put it in there, it stays in there. If it's an established account, account managers are supposed to be putting it in there and updating it for forecasting purposes.

111
00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:55.400
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And then when it gets ordered, or doesn't get ordered, it either gets marked closed one or closed lost, and then it just dies in there, and if it's closed one, it moves over to core. So, that's what's happening with that at the moment, as far as process. Did I miss anything, any of you? On the RF.

112
00:11:55.405 --> 00:12:00.664
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Sorry. He said moves, it may null again. If it doesn't move automatically.

113
00:12:00.665 --> 00:12:04.494
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): The user moves from Zendesk to coordinate. Yeah.

114
00:12:04.495 --> 00:12:23.924
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): The RFP side's a little similar, but slightly different in that there's another step, so they'll… it'll be entered into Zendesk and managed there, and then once that RFP lands, like, we get a formal request or submission from whatever the stakeholder is.

115
00:12:24.015 --> 00:12:32.155
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): that… Business developer or account manager will put in a formal project request through Asana to the marketing team.

116
00:12:32.285 --> 00:12:47.964
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): And in that request, they give a lot of background information, provide project links, documentation, all of the things, and then the marketing project manager schedules a kickoff call with the key stakeholders to review.

117
00:12:47.965 --> 00:13:03.484
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): But part of what's in that Asana request is also the projected volume, and so we track what that projected volume is versus what the actual volume is, so that we can see, like, how many people are overestimating, what is this really, and then over time, we can see, like.

118
00:13:03.705 --> 00:13:08.125
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Who's more accurate than others, and how do we allocate resources for projects?

119
00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:09.610
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Got it.

120
00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:11.070
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): So…

121
00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:18.459
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): When you go back to the RFP? You said the RFP gets to a certain stage, then there's a request for the project. What's that name of the stage again?

122
00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:28.810
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I think you're, she's just saying that we know an RFP's coming once it arrives. Yeah. Then the salesperson puts in a request to marketing to respond to the RFP.

123
00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:36.739
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So that's that step. Yeah. So, marketing is not tracking anything for an RP until they receive that request. Okay. Yeah, I gotcha.

124
00:13:36.745 --> 00:13:56.135
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): I would also say, like, in Zendesk, when our business development team gets a lead, whether it's, like, from even a tenants in the market list, or they're talking to a broker or an A&D firm, and they know something's coming, the amount of information that they decide to input on that lead in Zendesk varies

125
00:13:56.215 --> 00:14:04.485
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): widely. Like, some people will put activities or tasks or contacts in their lead in Zendesk, some people will not.

126
00:14:04.485 --> 00:14:10.584
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): that are actually working, and you have other people that are just licking everything and calling it theirs. Yeah, gotcha.

127
00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:24.699
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): There's another thing in Zendesk that I think would be really helpful for future marketing and sales enablement opportunities, which is, I think, if marketing had more insight into what some of those leads are and could see and track over time.

128
00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:32.439
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): the sectors and how the market is changing, then it would be easier for that team to create

129
00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:44.869
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Proactively create content to target it, but then also going back to what you were talking about with the email content, like, being able to have that insight to proactively create

130
00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:47.589
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Targeted email material.

131
00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:47.990
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): feeling.

132
00:14:47.990 --> 00:15:03.110
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Yeah, like, if we could see, like, okay, here's all of our contacts in the broker world, great. Here's our once a month, or once a quarter, we're posting our current market rates that we're seeing, like, by tier, you know, like, things like that. Or just…

133
00:15:03.115 --> 00:15:12.985
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): targeted campaigns right now. We have a one-size-fits-all, so when we do send something out, it's the same package, no matter what your role is, or involvement with us.

134
00:15:12.985 --> 00:15:20.144
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): great. Like, the grades aren't great, so there's just really no way right now to target.

135
00:15:20.385 --> 00:15:21.305
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): So…

136
00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:29.300
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): then you would want to target, like, a certain contact in the database based on their role, whether they're GC or… role and sector.

137
00:15:29.305 --> 00:15:31.564
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Sure. Because healthcare…

138
00:15:31.565 --> 00:15:33.805
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Like, if we see healthcare's trending up, or it's.

139
00:15:33.805 --> 00:15:47.865
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): We want to be able to tailor a message to our healthcare. Well, like, Alex's market is different than Jill's market, which is different from Kate's market, so we want to be able to tailor those markets by location and by what their focus may be. Yeah.

140
00:15:47.865 --> 00:16:12.235
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): The other thing that we run into with that, just not on the marketing side, but just on the communication side, like, if we need to email just clients a change in rates, or if we need to email vendors a change in process, like, right now we have to manually pull all that information, load all that in, which MailChimp gets really pissed off when you try to load in Excel, because they think you're going to spam a bunch of people, and then most of it bounces anyways.

141
00:16:12.235 --> 00:16:14.714
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So, like, being able to control

142
00:16:14.875 --> 00:16:19.565
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): just communication in general, whether it's marketing-specific or whatever.

143
00:16:19.565 --> 00:16:26.174
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): This is sort of a side note, but will this also then manage our customer service surveys? Yeah, we talked about that.

144
00:16:26.175 --> 00:16:27.774
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): literally couldn't. Yeah.

145
00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:30.150
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): So the… the ventilator Miller Knoll has a customer.

146
00:16:30.155 --> 00:16:32.305
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): customer service survey that I had.

147
00:16:32.305 --> 00:16:42.435
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): That communication to your partners can all be done in NetSuite pretty easily. When you're doing email marketing, one thing to consider is the…

148
00:16:42.675 --> 00:16:44.425
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): subscription status.

149
00:16:44.545 --> 00:16:46.565
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): They need to be opted in. Yeah.

150
00:16:46.565 --> 00:16:50.895
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And that's what we haven't been able to figure out how to do with core. Yeah. Because…

151
00:16:51.205 --> 00:17:05.264
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): collecting that information in that new client form, or it's being entered in manually by an account manager or salesperson, like, there's no chain of control for that data. It just gets put in, and then we're… because we're not emailing through Core.

152
00:17:05.525 --> 00:17:13.865
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): you know, we're pulling that information down and then uploading it into one link. So, I've never understood how you can get somebody to opt in if they're just, like, filling out any information.

153
00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:26.549
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Yeah, so if it's… if it's, like, transactional communication, or informational communication related to orders or anything like that, you don't… they don't have to opt into that. It's only when you're going to be doing some type of email campaign.

154
00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:34.480
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): And I'm sure… who's doing MailChimp right now? Someone on the marketing team. Okay, so they probably have gone through some type of opt-in campaign.

155
00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:40.559
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): No, to the, to the, to the recipients.

156
00:17:40.565 --> 00:17:42.134
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): I have to double-check with that. I can't.

157
00:17:42.135 --> 00:17:49.475
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Because there's all these, what is it, Ziplocan spam, or whatever, all these rules around you can email market to, they usually lie.

158
00:17:49.685 --> 00:17:55.134
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): What does the system even allow you, though? No, I don't think natural people. Yeah, if you can…

159
00:17:55.140 --> 00:18:03.170
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): give reason why, or do you basically state that, like, I'm not spamming these are different clients? Yeah, you can write this out. Yeah, because it's not…

160
00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:09.860
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Just random people, their email addresses from people that we've done business with, so… it's not like we're buying a little…

161
00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:10.680
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Definitely.

162
00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:19.430
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Yeah, this is an interesting point, though, that I think applies with a little deep into. We don't have… I don't think we have the unsubscribe option.

163
00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:37.149
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): who do automatically is put in their minds. Oh, okay. Yeah. So that's the one thing we do have to do, is, like, I have to… when I pull in all the new… well, what I've stopped doing is we usually just… I've said, keep giving everything, and now I know the pool dates, and so I say, okay, give me everything from this date to this current date, so that we're not…

164
00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:40.490
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): spamming people that haven't subscribed. Yeah.

165
00:18:40.495 --> 00:18:44.495
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): So NetSuite will manage that for you automatically. Okay.

166
00:18:44.825 --> 00:18:51.585
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): But if they've unsubscribed and I need to tell them about a rate change, I can still send that, even if they've unsubscribed, or they won't get that information.

167
00:18:51.585 --> 00:18:58.325
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): send it through an email campaign. You could send it directly to them from inside NetSuite, and not through the email campaign functioned.

168
00:18:58.325 --> 00:19:05.025
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Right now, we send those emails out as info at kvm-hoag.com. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, you can do that.

169
00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:06.849
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Couple different ways, okay.

170
00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:09.999
Cornerstone: So, the email marketing…

171
00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:12.909
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): I, I'm… So we have a CRM.

172
00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:18.669
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): After this, how many people in here will be part of the CRM discussion as well?

173
00:19:18.675 --> 00:19:25.934
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): sales leaders will be. Okay. So everybody but Carlos and Jillian. Okay. They're marketing-specific. Okay, so…

174
00:19:26.495 --> 00:19:29.724
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): It's funny to call you marketing specifically.

175
00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:30.839
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): the opposite of marketing.

176
00:19:30.845 --> 00:19:33.404
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I tried to explain it over lunch, yeah.

177
00:19:33.935 --> 00:19:42.704
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): So, let's focus on just, like, the email marketing, maybe… do you do any, like, showroom events?

178
00:19:43.085 --> 00:19:48.195
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): like, things like that. Let's talk about that for, to kind of focus on here, because we will talk a lot more about CRM, but…

179
00:19:48.445 --> 00:19:52.754
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): So you'll have the availability to do the email marketing inside of NetSuite.

180
00:19:52.865 --> 00:19:59.265
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): The one thing to note is whoever's creating those MailChimp email, templates?

181
00:19:59.725 --> 00:20:02.735
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): They probably have some time with… Use the templates.

182
00:20:02.735 --> 00:20:23.324
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): We do everything in slides, so we'll create, like, an image, and then we'll just embed that into MailChimp. And the reason we do that is because we… it's so important to have collaborative capabilities for many people working on a thing, and so we just really… any program… we try to avoid any programs where we can't collaborate.

183
00:20:23.325 --> 00:20:24.474
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): as a team.

184
00:20:24.475 --> 00:20:49.084
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): And so, that's why we really join slides for everything. But just going to this, it is so rare that we're doing any sort of, like, email campaign, even for an event, because so much of what we do is relationship-based, and so we're being very selective of, like, hey, we want to invite these specific 20 people, and we're sending an email from a real person's email, rather than from info at KBM. So it's not actually even going through or being tracked

185
00:20:49.085 --> 00:20:51.354
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): through MailChimp. Like, it's just so rare that we're…

186
00:20:51.355 --> 00:20:54.594
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Yeah. Oh, so how many times a year do you think you use wheelchair?

187
00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:58.220
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): You are different in terms of, like, an ops standpoint?

188
00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:01.539
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I don't send stuff through MailChimp to customers, I send it…

189
00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:08.009
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Unfortunately, I sent it through my email address, and then I have to deal with all the stuff that bounces back, or responses.

190
00:21:09.050 --> 00:21:13.550
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yeah, I would say less than 6 times a year, because we don't even have…

191
00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:26.989
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): We have a pay-as-we-go MailChimp. We buy credits when we need them. We don't have a monthly or annual subscription with it. We used to do a quarterly newsletter, internal and external. We used to do event.

192
00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:29.200
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): We… the…

193
00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:38.899
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): information we got back from it was so little, so we've really refocused, and the GM strategic playlist last year has been all around targeted

194
00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:45.350
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): sectors, industries, and the people within them. So, mass emails.

195
00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:53.579
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): like, the capability is fine, and it's great to know that we can do it. It'll probably get underutilized compared to other market… other dealers. Okay, so she.

196
00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:57.769
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): So we not plan, really, to touch it during implementation lunch? Yeah.

197
00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:04.230
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yeah, okay. And then… Smart enough, like, an average person could figure it out if they wanted to.

198
00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:09.319
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): fire it up after the implementation, or do you need to be trained on it? Or does it need to be both? It's super easy.

199
00:22:09.325 --> 00:22:16.494
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): but email creation, like, if you're just posting an image in there, that's… that's fine. Yeah.

200
00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:22.079
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): the email creation's not, like, a really good, like, Missy Bay editor. Yeah, they've been getting around that.

201
00:22:22.085 --> 00:22:22.824
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): with,

202
00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:26.910
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): generating HTML email templates through AI. Yeah.

203
00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:34.060
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): We just need, like, a link. We need, like, an image with a link that says RSVP, or whatever it is. Like, that's as simple as it is.

204
00:22:34.065 --> 00:22:41.134
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): The marketing team doesn't use the template, but when they send it to me to load it, I use the template to release the thing of it.

205
00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:41.750
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Okay.

206
00:22:41.755 --> 00:22:49.094
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And we also can do stuff in InDesign, or, like, we have other options if we need to, so… I do think…

207
00:22:49.100 --> 00:23:08.580
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): if it was easier, just being a little bit of condensed here, but, like, if we did have a curated list of brokers and PM firms or CM firms, and, like, we did send out quarterly, oh, here's some market rates we're seeing, or something that we feel like would add value, and it was easier, we didn't have to recreate the wheel every time, I could see us using it.

208
00:23:08.585 --> 00:23:11.714
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): if we actually use a CRM to be a CRM, and

209
00:23:11.915 --> 00:23:30.455
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): we're able to create campaigns like you would in Salesforce and have targeted approach. We've just… the data entry part of it has never been clean enough to trust in. And the options that Core provides for, like, the type of client is like, well, are they the main contact? Are they finance? Is it the procurement?

210
00:23:30.455 --> 00:23:32.864
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Right. And we don't know. So…

211
00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:44.390
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): I personally need to… and need and want to know how it works in terms of segmenting users and groups and the tagging, and I think that that

212
00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:52.059
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Would be… fall somewhere between marketing and sales, and be a collaborative effort there to really fine-tune that, so that we can.

213
00:23:52.065 --> 00:23:57.435
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Well, you need sales to tell you who they are and what they are, so that you can decide how to utilize the information.

214
00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:00.040
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): Yeah, exactly. And you can segment, and…

215
00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:06.759
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): Slice and dice and create any list you want, but it is contingent on having that…

216
00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:09.250
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Pooh in, poo out.

217
00:24:09.665 --> 00:24:15.034
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): So, okay, so that covers email marketing, we won't plan for much there, but the showroom events…

218
00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:18.020
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Talk to me about those. How often do you do those?

219
00:24:18.450 --> 00:24:20.700
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Depends on what you describe as an event.

220
00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:27.040
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So we do showroom tours, More so than not.

221
00:24:28.090 --> 00:24:31.999
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Jill, you're the busiest with this at the moment, so pipe in at any time.

222
00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:37.569
Jill Marsh: Yeah, well, I was just gonna say, I feel like we're probably doing something maybe twice a month at this point.

223
00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:42.459
Jill Marsh: For sure, Yeah, tours and… And today we have a…

224
00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:45.880
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Cocktail creation thing happening at 4, right? Canceled it, which got canceled.

225
00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:47.859
Jill Marsh: canceled, unfortunately, yeah.

226
00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:48.950
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Play invite only?

227
00:24:49.450 --> 00:24:51.090
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): And then do you try continuous?

228
00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:54.290
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Do you track attendance?

229
00:24:54.290 --> 00:25:00.149
Jill Marsh: We don't track attend… it depends on the type of event, so I guess that's not a black and white answer either, but .

230
00:25:00.150 --> 00:25:00.500
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And we'd.

231
00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:12.270
Jill Marsh: It is usually targeted, the invite is targeted to, you know, is it a particular A&D firm? Is it, a certain customer? So.

232
00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:17.490
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): An client tour versus an event versus a finish review, like…

233
00:25:17.490 --> 00:25:18.690
Jill Marsh: Exactly.

234
00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:19.739
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Use Google Forms.

235
00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:23.470
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): If we're sending something out and we do need to track.

236
00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:28.869
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): RSVPs and headcount, so we'll send out a link just through Google Forms.

237
00:25:29.150 --> 00:25:35.450
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Right now, if there's a showroom event, there's a showroom event form that whoever's hosting is supposed to fill out.

238
00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:54.690
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): But it's really more of a coordination form. So it tells the showroom manager how many people are coming, who's coming, how many people are coming? Do you need a snack? Do you need a lunch? Do you need breakfast? Do you want beverages? Do you need booze? What room do you want? What are you trying to accomplish? But it's all really just operational, so that it's like they know what to do logistically to get things ready.

239
00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:56.040
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yeah, sounds kind of.

240
00:25:56.040 --> 00:26:04.690
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): kind of poking around this topic, because… let me, let me kind of lay out a potential solution. You tell me if you think it would be worthwhile. So,

241
00:26:04.890 --> 00:26:10.360
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): you send out the invite from NetSuite to whoever's going to potentially be attending the event.

242
00:26:10.890 --> 00:26:11.889
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Or you could.

243
00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:20.530
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): We could, but again, if we would do it in NetSuite, send it as someone? Yeah, is it gonna come from Netflix?

244
00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:23.759
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): It needs to be a personalized approach.

245
00:26:23.765 --> 00:26:36.484
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): You can even have an email signature on it as well, if you come from a particular person. Yeah. And then you'll have an attendance dashboard inside NetSuite to track who actually showed up. So I invited this person, these are the people that showed up. Who manages that?

246
00:26:36.785 --> 00:26:39.645
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): You would have to tell me. Who does, who would do that? Oh, no one, no one's coming.

247
00:26:39.650 --> 00:26:43.260
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): coming in and taking headcount. Like, no one's, like… At events, they are.

248
00:26:43.265 --> 00:26:53.845
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): At our grand opening, we had people checking people in and keeping track of who actually showed up versus who showed up, who was not invited, and we let it anyways. Like, we tracked all of that.

249
00:26:53.845 --> 00:27:00.504
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): You can at least tracking who you invited and showed up, and then… then… because if then there's opportunities that are created.

250
00:27:00.505 --> 00:27:03.715
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Right now, we do that through paperless posts, by the way. Okay. Yeah.

251
00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:19.519
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): If there's opportunities that are created and they're assigned as an influencer and the opportunity, you would have visibility into that. So, I had this event, I invited this person, they showed up, and then, within the past 6 months, here's all the opportunities that they were an influencer on. Is that information valuable to you? I mean.

252
00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:21.330
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): I think…

253
00:27:21.670 --> 00:27:27.180
Jill Marsh: I mean, I guess it could be. I mean, we generally don't see…

254
00:27:27.610 --> 00:27:38.469
Jill Marsh: like, it's hard to track that return on investment of, like, doing, you know, this event with this person, but I also say usually when we're inviting them to an event, there's a reason.

255
00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:45.859
Jill Marsh: A lot, too, where we're like, hey, we gotta get in front of this firm, because we know that they've got, like, some certain activity going on, so…

256
00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:46.320
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Let's turn.

257
00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:49.989
Jill Marsh: You know, be kind of. Yeah, so it is targeted, exactly.

258
00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:51.430
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): a day.

259
00:27:51.430 --> 00:28:02.420
Jill Marsh: But we definitely don't have any information now to tie back, like, oh, we invited this particular person to 5 different things, and now, look, they sent us, like, a new bid, you know?

260
00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:17.460
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I mean, I'd like to know, because some of these people we've spent thousands of tens of thousands of dollars on, and they give us zero business, and I'm like, okay, cool, that's just called a friend, and you should spend your money on them, but not our money. Like, yeah. So what we're trying to do.

261
00:28:17.465 --> 00:28:27.984
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): is we're trying to keep all the data in one system, and then be able to generate reports like that that says, okay, here's all the opportunities that I want, and here's all the time this influencer was part of that opportunity, or vice versa.

262
00:28:27.985 --> 00:28:37.524
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Because right now, like, in Core, you can do it in Zendesk, where you can, like, add influencers to your opportunity, right? So, like, we have, JLL.

263
00:28:37.865 --> 00:28:45.805
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): and then we have all of our contacts at JLL under JLL. And if the lead comes from JLL, if the salesperson chooses to do so, they could add that

264
00:28:45.805 --> 00:29:02.415
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): as a lead generator, they could add that person, and then we could technically pull a report and see how many leads came from that person, or came from JLL in general. So, to be able to continue to do that, or make that more easy for people to do, so that maybe they would show us that, we could

265
00:29:02.415 --> 00:29:08.404
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): track that information better than what we're tracking it today. The other thing that's…

266
00:29:08.955 --> 00:29:12.315
Cornerstone: Not happening, or doesn't always happen, is, like.

267
00:29:12.425 --> 00:29:15.174
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yeah, when we do an event.

268
00:29:15.265 --> 00:29:18.514
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): We invite people, or like, let's say we invite a firm.

269
00:29:18.565 --> 00:29:26.865
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): we invite Gensler over, and we host an event. And they send all of their junior non-specifiers, instead of the people that could actually give us business.

270
00:29:26.865 --> 00:29:46.485
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): there's still opportunity there, but the opportunity changes, so then how do we track all those people? How do we start to follow their career and figure out who's progressing and who's not progressing? And, like, there's a lot of strategy behind all that, but it takes a lot of energy, and right now, I'd say most of our energy goes into who can give me what I need now versus who can give me something later. Sure.

271
00:29:47.610 --> 00:29:51.839
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): So in those cases, you can track the company, or you can track the contacts at the company.

272
00:29:51.845 --> 00:29:54.575
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I can't do any of that in Core, I can only do that in Zendesk.

273
00:29:54.845 --> 00:29:57.105
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Yeah, I'm sorry, that's what you… That's what I was trying.

274
00:29:57.105 --> 00:30:00.284
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I get too, sorry, thank you for bringing me back to my whole point. Yeah.

275
00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:19.990
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So, like, right now, I would like, okay, we invited… we have a… well, I guess in Salesforce, you'd call that a campaign. We have a campaign, and then you could progress that people, individuals from that campaign into actual sales results. Yeah. So, if we had a showroom event, and you list 15 people that actually showed up.

276
00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:33.840
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): and later you could say on an order, oh, I got this project from this person, I could go back and tie that all the way back to that campaign, or I could just see, oh, I've had this person at 9 campaigns, I've never done anything with it, why do I keep inviting them?

277
00:30:33.845 --> 00:30:38.074
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): Not only the revenue, but also the costs of those events, too. Yeah.

278
00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:46.720
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So that's something we're not doing today that I would like to do, but it is added work and takes training. It is, yeah, yeah. It's available to you.

279
00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:51.909
Jill Marsh: I think a component that's a little bit missing is that, honestly, a lot of that,

280
00:30:52.570 --> 00:30:56.870
Jill Marsh: Hosting of people is done more on, like, a one-on-one

281
00:30:57.520 --> 00:31:09.339
Jill Marsh: type of thing, versus, like, a vent in the showroom. So, Matt, I think we just have to keep that in mind, too. Like, we know, you know, Owen's gonna be constantly taking out

282
00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:19.360
Jill Marsh: Doug, but does Doug come to, like, our showroom event? No, but we spend a ton of money on him, and we do know that a bunch of RFPs come from their company, you know?

283
00:31:19.550 --> 00:31:33.079
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Right, and I don't know if Zendesk does this, but when we had Salesforce, Owen could go directly to Doug and say, I took Doug… he could add an event under Doug that said, I took Doug to coffee, or I took Doug golfing.

284
00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:43.919
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And so, you could show activity under an individual. Like, it'll let you do it at an individual event, like, there's multiple levels of how you could tie people back to interaction.

285
00:31:43.925 --> 00:31:47.735
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): So it'd be so cool to see, like, the ROI of an investment on a relationship.

286
00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:48.130
Jill Marsh: Yeah.

287
00:31:48.130 --> 00:32:00.439
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): like, I spent $6,000 on this person, and I got $3 million. Okay, great. Like, that's in one tier versus somebody else, where I spent $2,000 and I've gotten, like, a chair order, you know?

288
00:32:00.445 --> 00:32:07.745
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): But it's getting salespeople to actually do it, which is the hard part. Yeah. But we could go back to, on our expenses.

289
00:32:07.805 --> 00:32:24.005
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): going all the way back to our expenses is we do ask people on their expenses to list the attendees when they submit an expense, so if we can try Expensify or whatever we're using to pull that information to that… there's a matching contact in

290
00:32:24.225 --> 00:32:26.585
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): System, we could log all of them.

291
00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:37.260
Jill Marsh: Yeah, and I mean, my… the salespeople do… do that, at least. I don't know if, Kate and Alex, that happens in your offices, but in San Francisco, I make them put who attended

292
00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:40.400
Jill Marsh: Whatever dinner or drinks or whatever it was.

293
00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:41.140
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Yeah.

294
00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:41.460
Alex Blangeres: Yeah.

295
00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:45.449
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): I think the one thing that also is a little bit hard is if we're doing it right.

296
00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:48.830
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): It's not about Brian, it's just a way, yeah.

297
00:32:48.835 --> 00:33:08.355
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): I mean, if our VD team is doing it right, okay, okay. It could be like, okay, you know, we took Aaron on the ski trip in Tahoe, but, you know, then we're doing things with George Fox. Well, they're both… we're trying to surround the deal from multiple influencers, so then it gets a little bit… But you can add all those influencers.

298
00:33:08.485 --> 00:33:11.335
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Okay, you know what I mean. Yeah, maybe it's firm.

299
00:33:11.335 --> 00:33:14.614
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): not person, but you have the ability to… Well, they're in different firms, I mean…

300
00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:19.729
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): That's the broker EM, like, we don't all of them.

301
00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:24.579
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): And so I just want to… at this point, I guess I just want to make sure it's available to you. To take it one step further.

302
00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:28.150
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): On the Influencer, you could also do a contribution percentage.

303
00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:40.940
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Now, that requires somebody to fill it out. Right. Now, you could say, well, this person was primary… the primary influencer. Yep. And then you could say they get 50% contribution, everybody else puts the rest evenly. There's a couple of different attribution models you can do.

304
00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:52.220
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): I just want to make sure that you know that that's available to you. I don't know what would be most valuable to you. Is it baked in, or is it something we have to add? That's something that we would add. We've been thinking… we've been talking about doing that, to try and get down to this…

305
00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:58.199
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): reporting for dealers, where… because you guys do it a little bit different. Like, when you do a typical campaign.

306
00:33:58.390 --> 00:34:06.860
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): and you're trying to tie cost to ROI, well, your end user is the ROI, it's not your influencer, whereas in your guys' case, it's the influencer that you need to try.

307
00:34:07.095 --> 00:34:21.774
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Well, we always say, like, it's everybody, because we're just one of many. Like, the influencer can be the PM, could also be the architect, it could also be the real estate broker, it could also be the client, like, it could be 5 people that are influencing whether

308
00:34:21.775 --> 00:34:35.954
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): we get in or not, and it's almost like a jury, like, we need a majority of that group to want us to push it our way. So we have to track all those people. We're never just going after one person on a deal. There are many people.

309
00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:45.160
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Yeah, that's why we allow you to attach all those influencers to the deal. Like, really, the question is the attribution model. Do you want it to be split up evenly, or do you want it to have some other

310
00:34:45.650 --> 00:34:47.949
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Attribution percentage split.

311
00:34:48.750 --> 00:34:54.459
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): You should just default to an even, and then somebody would manipulate differently if they chose to do so.

312
00:34:54.465 --> 00:35:03.445
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Then you can have a report in that says we're basically… it's almost kind of like an effectiveness rating based on the contribution percentage and the toggle of the order, things like that.

313
00:35:03.445 --> 00:35:23.035
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Well, the other thing that that data would actually give you that could be beneficial is you could go, oh, damn, the same 6 people keep showing up as a group all the time. Same architect is with the same GC, with the same VM. How do I become part of that group or become their best friends? Because I want to do everything they're doing. Yeah. So it'd give you trends around who's hot and who's not.

314
00:35:23.035 --> 00:35:26.705
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): On the influence market. What are you guys wrapping up?

315
00:35:26.705 --> 00:35:28.574
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Yeah, it's just great.

316
00:35:28.580 --> 00:35:34.919
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): And then just, like, putting a tabloid report together of, like, look who we saw together.

317
00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:39.480
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): Starting to feel like an upset. Healer Digest? Yeah.

318
00:35:39.930 --> 00:35:43.200
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Cool past page 9. Yeah. Yeah.

319
00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:46.519
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): So that's available. I just want to try and…

320
00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:52.820
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): find out, for at least for Phase 1, what can we do from a marketing perspective to support you guys?

321
00:35:53.010 --> 00:35:55.949
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So for, like, if we're just gonna keep status quo.

322
00:35:56.130 --> 00:35:59.990
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): For this topic of what we're talking about under marketing bracket.

323
00:36:00.110 --> 00:36:02.129
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): We would keep the web forum.

324
00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:18.590
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Because we have it today, and it serves a purpose, and it'd be weird to be a business without a web form. And then lead generation would be the same as it is today. People enter leads, whether that's sales, or whether that's an account manager or an account executive.

325
00:36:18.730 --> 00:36:29.589
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Around the, you know, I believe this project might happen. And they entered in a lead, and as it progresses in viability, it would change to an opportunity.

326
00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:30.359
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): a little more.

327
00:36:30.365 --> 00:36:37.354
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): tracking and data and metrics around those opportunities so that we can target campaigns. Because, like, we do want to do that.

328
00:36:37.610 --> 00:36:47.669
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yeah, we would like to do that. Yeah. No, I was just saying, that's the bottom, like, the bottom of the barrel is those two things. It's basically what's happening with our lead generation at this point.

329
00:36:47.830 --> 00:36:48.360
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And…

330
00:36:48.365 --> 00:36:54.125
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): And what point do you say, okay, this lead should be… so we should create an opportunity for this lead? What's the…

331
00:36:54.265 --> 00:36:55.105
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Key factor there.

332
00:36:55.105 --> 00:37:03.895
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): I think most of our business development team actually creates it as an opportunity, and there is a lead stage under opportunity. That's correct.

333
00:37:04.890 --> 00:37:25.099
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): We have a few people, Nick and Troy mainly, that are doing it under a lead category, because if you search, you can find it either way, it just has a different symbol on Zendesk to the left of it. But for the most part, people are creating it as an opportunity with a lead stage, and then as it progresses, like, let's say we get the RFP, it changes to an RFP stage.

334
00:37:25.105 --> 00:37:27.805
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Gotcha. Okay. Yeah, we've got some sitting over, right?

335
00:37:27.955 --> 00:37:31.104
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): We'll have somebody create the opportunity, and the stage will be targeting.

336
00:37:31.275 --> 00:37:32.955
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Yeah. And then…

337
00:37:33.245 --> 00:37:38.385
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): they make contact with somebody, then it changes to in-discussion, and then it kind of goes through those stages, so…

338
00:37:39.005 --> 00:37:55.734
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): this kind of spills in a little bit into CRM again, but I think for your company, the topic… the two topics are really intertwined. They're the same. Yeah, marketing and CRM. So, I think one thing we'll do then, too, is for… when it comes to VRD time, instead of doing the separate one for marketing CRM, we'll probably set up one for marketing and CRM. Okay.

339
00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:03.620
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): It's basically the exact same group for the next hour. Yeah.

340
00:38:04.050 --> 00:38:12.919
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Minus marketing, but we… they could stay in the room, so if we… if this topic's running thin, we can jump to the next one and get it all knocked out at once.

341
00:38:12.925 --> 00:38:20.895
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Yeah, we probably can, because it really is kind of already trying to talk about opportunity management and activity management. Okay.

342
00:38:21.925 --> 00:38:27.215
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): So let me jump… equipment, CRM.

343
00:38:29.045 --> 00:38:36.165
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Talk about a few things. So, NetSuite Orion functionality available to you, contact and relationship management. So, not just customers, but contacts.

344
00:38:36.395 --> 00:38:44.625
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Opportunity… activity management. I don't know if you guys are doing… tracking your activity in NetSuite? I'm sorry, in Zendesk? Some people…

345
00:38:44.625 --> 00:38:45.795
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): more than others. Okay.

346
00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:55.839
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): You have that all available to you, typical CRM functionality, pipeline management. Netsuite calls it… what you guys call forecasting, NetSuite calls it pipeline.

347
00:38:55.950 --> 00:39:01.459
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): the same thing. Yeah. Sales management, do you have any concept of territories?

348
00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:04.959
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Not really. Okay, good.

349
00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:10.990
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Gross profit calculations on the… well, target gross profit calculations on ops, that feature pipeline.

350
00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:18.909
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): We do have Kanban boards. Are you guys using, like, any type of Trello boards or anything to manage opportunities or anything in your organization?

351
00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:31.369
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): design boards or anything like that? What do you mean by design boards? So, you know, the card system, like, planner, like, is it any functionality like that? Talking about, like, blue sheeting?

352
00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:34.519
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): strategy sessions were like, why are you laughing?

353
00:39:34.525 --> 00:39:35.264
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): John so much.

354
00:39:35.270 --> 00:39:36.400
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I haven't heard blue cheating.

355
00:39:38.010 --> 00:39:41.279
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): You need to come up with, like, the most standard term…

356
00:39:41.285 --> 00:39:43.524
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I remember when Noel was really hot on sushi.

357
00:39:43.525 --> 00:39:46.525
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): So, yeah, I just was wondering if it was, like…

358
00:39:46.525 --> 00:39:53.885
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): It was basically, like, a way of managing the tasks, and agents… giving people agency to move things around depending on, like, where they are.

359
00:39:54.430 --> 00:39:55.980
Jill Marsh: The only…

360
00:39:56.780 --> 00:39:57.890
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): The actual?

361
00:39:57.890 --> 00:40:07.199
Jill Marsh: Oh, I was just gonna say, if we are doing some sort of, like, strategy planning, like, like a blue sheet type of thing, it's usually in, like, like a slide deck.

362
00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:09.759
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So maybe there's a particular…

363
00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:22.400
Jill Marsh: account or opportunity we're trying to circle, you know? Like, we're all trying to surround. We just have, like, notes in a deck with, like, who the players are, and, like, kind of all the information put into a slide deck.

364
00:40:24.210 --> 00:40:28.000
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Oh, that's good. You might be the first dealer that's not using them, which is totally fine.

365
00:40:28.365 --> 00:40:38.144
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I think we're the first dealer who doesn't even know what they are. So… What was that… what was that board we used when we took over… Muro. We could use Muro for a while.

366
00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:50.580
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Yeah. So, yeah, Trello or Monday has them, but basically it's the card system, you kind of move it through the statuses visually. I have one dealer that has two different systems that does the same thing. They just love them so much.

367
00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:51.160
Alex Blangeres: But.

368
00:40:51.385 --> 00:40:53.985
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Are we missing out on something?

369
00:40:54.330 --> 00:40:54.900
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): complicated.

370
00:40:54.905 --> 00:40:57.144
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Seems complicated. I mean, we have, like, we're not.

371
00:40:57.145 --> 00:41:00.485
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): use Nero, I think it is complicated. That's a little bit.

372
00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:06.719
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Yeah, Miro's… yeah, Miro's a little bit different than a hand on board, but I mean, the concept came from

373
00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:19.239
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): software development, actually. The ticketing system, and you would move your software ticket through the stages. But, we built that into the system. All the… the reason why I'm asking is because we do have a Canon Manager, or PIN system. What is it, like.

374
00:41:19.245 --> 00:41:22.004
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): How would it be used for CRM?

375
00:41:22.205 --> 00:41:24.905
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I could think it would be used for, like, a project, but tell me how it'd be used.

376
00:41:24.905 --> 00:41:32.405
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): for CRM? Yeah, so specifically for your opportunities. So your opportunities have statuses. Okay. And then, so you come to your board, you see your whole opportunity pipeline.

377
00:41:32.405 --> 00:41:40.685
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): What? So, if I'm, like, going retro, I'm imagining a corkboard with, like, masking tape, kind of… Yes.

378
00:41:40.685 --> 00:41:41.435
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Like, going…

379
00:41:41.625 --> 00:41:42.905
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Serial killer.

380
00:41:42.905 --> 00:41:45.904
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): No, I was a schoolteacher.

381
00:41:46.665 --> 00:41:55.114
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Which school teachers are… do have some serial killer vibes, but no, okay. I just want to visualize, like, what the purpose of it is.

382
00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:55.490
Jill Marsh: Yep.

383
00:41:55.490 --> 00:41:56.319
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I swear.

384
00:41:56.320 --> 00:42:00.010
Jill Marsh: I still feel like when we've done that, it's always been, like, in a slide deck.

385
00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:00.880
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Oh, I'.

386
00:42:02.770 --> 00:42:12.130
Jill Marsh: Miller Knoll creates those a lot in slide decks, or, like, when we were, like, we're trying to target these, like, education clients, like, it… we have a slide deck with, like.

387
00:42:12.130 --> 00:42:16.320
Cornerstone: influencer names, and maybe their org charts are in there. It's all just…

388
00:42:16.330 --> 00:42:18.540
Jill Marsh: Manually, we put it together.

389
00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:24.019
Jill Marsh: in a deck to track off of, and like, what are the next steps? And it's just, like, outlined on a slide.

390
00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:27.439
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Well, maybe we should start using Kyle. So, other teams…

391
00:42:27.445 --> 00:42:49.924
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): this, like, this is what we use on our team, which is essentially that idea, like, it is rooted in Scrum methodologies, which is, like, all of the projects and tasks, and then they're assigned to the people, what's next, what's up, and then this gets moved around in priority order. It's the same idea, just in digital form, and then all of the projects… Do they sell? No, this is just Google Docs.

392
00:42:49.925 --> 00:42:52.185
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): with that.

393
00:42:52.190 --> 00:43:02.420
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): This is Google Docs, actually. It's, like, the equivalent of Word. And so it's… there's a template at the bottom, and then so when you have a new

394
00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:17.689
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): project versus template. You just copy this, you put the details, it's there, it has all the key project links, so, like, everyone on the team has all the information in one place, and that's used every single day to manage tasks and, like, see what's been done, see what needs.

395
00:43:17.695 --> 00:43:20.055
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): Yeah, okay. But that's on the…

396
00:43:20.670 --> 00:43:26.110
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): This is for RFP management and any marketing resources. Okay. The pace of that is…

397
00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:45.430
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Gotcha. I'm almost more interested in it from the account manager side, the project management side of, like, here's all my projects, and they're in different stages, and so therefore, like, I know, like, oh, everything in this column still needs to get, like, a field verification, or I need to get quotes for all of these, or, like, it could dump tasks

398
00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:49.419
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): into buckets… Yeah. …by project, but…

399
00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:52.779
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I don't know that sales would use it on the front end. Yeah, that's really.

400
00:43:52.785 --> 00:43:56.905
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): for design, too. So we know what those deliverables are going to be up front.

401
00:43:57.115 --> 00:43:57.665
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Yeah.

402
00:43:57.825 --> 00:44:09.714
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): So we have a version for design, we have a version for opportunities, you can use it for tasks, anything… any record in the system that has a status, you can use it for, because you can visually move through the status.

403
00:44:09.885 --> 00:44:11.824
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Yeah, so, I think Chris is trying to…

404
00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:17.140
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And now that I think about it, we have it in Zendesk, we just never look at it and then be…

405
00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:23.389
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): It's the one where it gets put in that view, and we're like, oh god, what is that?

406
00:44:28.710 --> 00:44:33.490
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Oh, it wouldn't… What's this?

407
00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:38.040
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): Yeah. Yeah, that's it. That is it. Yeah. No, I don't like.

408
00:44:39.545 --> 00:44:41.045
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): That stresses me up.

409
00:44:41.045 --> 00:44:41.864
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): That's a lot in there.

410
00:44:41.865 --> 00:44:44.514
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): It's overwhelming. It needs to be filtered down by person.

411
00:44:44.675 --> 00:44:47.225
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): This is just empty. Right, that would be better. Yeah.

412
00:44:47.780 --> 00:44:52.300
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Okay, okay, so… We're just, we're just going back. I don't show sleep right now.

413
00:44:52.305 --> 00:44:55.205
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Here, I'll just… Take control really quickly.

414
00:44:55.380 --> 00:44:56.529
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): Just said that.

415
00:44:56.800 --> 00:44:58.750
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Alex and Kate know what we're looking at.

416
00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:01.249
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So, it's this view.

417
00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:05.450
Cornerstone: Where it helps you prioritize, like, where do you need to spend your time?

418
00:45:05.450 --> 00:45:06.120
Alex Blangeres: Yeah.

419
00:45:06.350 --> 00:45:06.810
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Too long.

420
00:45:06.810 --> 00:45:07.930
Jill Marsh: Oh, okay.

421
00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:11.320
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): But this is showing every… here, let's look at,

422
00:45:18.510 --> 00:45:19.500
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): This one.

423
00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:22.289
Cornerstone: So it's a little easier to…

424
00:45:22.330 --> 00:45:25.670
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): manage, yeah. That's by month, so it's month.

425
00:45:26.420 --> 00:45:33.970
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): So, the way some people are using this is, like, for a sales manager, we'll sit down with the sales rep, they'll look at all their opportunities.

426
00:45:34.190 --> 00:45:51.099
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): So, they can visualize the opportunities, and, you know, they have particular headlines and sub-headlines for the dollar amount, the expected close date, things like that. From there, they can edit, manage, move things through statuses, and use it as kind of like a pipeline checkup.

427
00:45:51.650 --> 00:45:53.759
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): And I think there's also the ability to have.

428
00:45:53.765 --> 00:45:58.405
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): APIs per column or status as well, so you're like, okay, there's…

429
00:45:58.995 --> 00:46:02.664
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): $500,000 stuck in this phase right here, cannot move it up.

430
00:46:03.375 --> 00:46:04.665
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): This is good, too, for the.

431
00:46:04.665 --> 00:46:10.435
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): This one looks great. It's clean, because if this is opportunities closing next month, I would expect to see nothing in the.

432
00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:18.380
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): lead RFP sections for sure, and those were empty, so this would be good for, like, if I did see something in there, that's a problem.

433
00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:24.749
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): I think, like, I mean, I have this, right? Or individuals that I've created. I just look at it and…

434
00:46:25.090 --> 00:46:29.139
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): the same view that we look at, so I've created…

435
00:46:29.145 --> 00:46:34.685
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): It's just different versions of… if it's automatically built into their system, and it gives…

436
00:46:35.105 --> 00:46:36.885
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Like, sure, what is that?

437
00:46:36.995 --> 00:46:38.285
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yeah. Okay.

438
00:46:38.290 --> 00:46:38.750
Jill Marsh: Yeah.

439
00:46:38.750 --> 00:46:39.550
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Me too.

440
00:46:40.090 --> 00:46:47.639
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I mean, by using it, it's just… it's already there, right? You're just looking at it in that view? Yeah, correct.

441
00:46:48.590 --> 00:46:52.129
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): There's, like, a little bit of configuration. I mean, the nice thing is, I think, like, that this is.

442
00:46:52.135 --> 00:46:55.195
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): as much as…

443
00:46:56.865 --> 00:47:04.534
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): programming, I could move it to awarded, and it would change the deal stage for me. So it just makes things move faster.

444
00:47:04.540 --> 00:47:09.110
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Melody in Zendesk. Oh, it doesn't.

445
00:47:09.245 --> 00:47:09.965
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): Good.

446
00:47:09.970 --> 00:47:15.329
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Because we have issues with that. So basically, we don't forecast anything below 70%.

447
00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:24.000
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So whenever we say forecast, it's 70% or greater. Okay. Oh. Yeah. But yeah. Anything below that would technically be a lead or in work.

448
00:47:24.005 --> 00:47:29.375
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): I do have them created for all my salespeople. I just look at it in this view. Yeah, so if you switch to the.

449
00:47:29.375 --> 00:47:33.425
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): bar view next to it, it would give you the same… the bucket. Right. Yeah. Can you…

450
00:47:33.430 --> 00:47:48.930
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): prioritize these. So, like, you could sit down with a salesperson and say, okay, I know you're going in programming here, what is your top priority, where do you need new resources? And then be able to, like, move that up or down in the list here.

451
00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:49.510
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): So…

452
00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:53.200
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): by name right now, but I think you could change…

453
00:47:54.180 --> 00:47:57.640
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Oh, I still think we can sort. We can't sort ours, can we? Oh, right now it's cl…

454
00:47:57.645 --> 00:47:59.145
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Sorted by estimated close.

455
00:47:59.145 --> 00:47:59.944
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): I don't know one.

456
00:47:59.945 --> 00:48:02.374
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): in the house, you know.

457
00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:04.250
Jill Marsh: Yeah, I was…

458
00:48:04.250 --> 00:48:04.660
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): for, like.

459
00:48:04.660 --> 00:48:08.160
Jill Marsh: do the same. I was gonna say, it's usually about, like.

460
00:48:08.370 --> 00:48:14.900
Jill Marsh: The date of the opportunity, so, like, what's coming up the soonest, or the volume, the dollar volume.

461
00:48:15.070 --> 00:48:16.400
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yeah, this one's kind of…

462
00:48:17.110 --> 00:48:26.929
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Not the best example, because we're only showing opportunities closing in one month, but if we looked at an individual for their whole booking year, then you can start prioritizing based off of that.

463
00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:28.060
Jill Marsh: Yeah.

464
00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:36.670
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Or it would show them where they have holes, like, oh, you need… You don't have enough in your pipeline. You don't have enough in your pipeline, you're gonna be dry by. Yeah. Yeah.

465
00:48:36.670 --> 00:48:37.330
Jill Marsh: Yeah.

466
00:48:38.910 --> 00:48:41.970
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Okay, so we can re… no, it's okay, we can revisit this.

467
00:48:42.150 --> 00:48:44.909
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Again, but, they are available to you.

468
00:48:44.910 --> 00:48:48.849
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Okay, I think it'd be a good tool for us to try and test out.

469
00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:53.679
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I never knew that's what it was called. Thank you for educating us.

470
00:48:53.685 --> 00:48:58.274
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): I thought we were talking about leads, that's why I was like, like, strategy, then blue shoes.

471
00:48:58.275 --> 00:48:59.165
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): They did.

472
00:48:59.490 --> 00:49:01.350
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): I've heard of gold sheets, too, but that…

473
00:49:02.070 --> 00:49:07.019
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Nothing. Noel got really hot on blue shooting one year, and it's all they wanted to talk about. Yep.

474
00:49:07.025 --> 00:49:10.515
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): meeting. Mina's bringing me food, sorry. No, that's fine.

475
00:49:12.110 --> 00:49:12.910
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Okay.

476
00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:15.220
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Sorry, I'm trying to get back to where I was.

477
00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:19.329
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Are we doing on time? We have… We're good. Okay.

478
00:49:19.650 --> 00:49:23.389
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): mobile portal access, so there is a NetSuite mobile app

479
00:49:23.610 --> 00:49:29.330
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): We use it for, like, limited use cases, and a really good one is Quick Add Lead, Quick Add Up.

480
00:49:30.020 --> 00:49:31.190
Cornerstone: On the mobile phone.

481
00:49:32.430 --> 00:49:33.510
Cornerstone: And then any…

482
00:49:33.510 --> 00:49:36.440
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): integration capabilities. We talk about that in case, like.

483
00:49:36.700 --> 00:49:44.829
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): you might be married to Salesforce, well, there's an integration for Salesforce, but you're not, so that's a great fit, especially since it costs so much.

484
00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:45.980
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Alright.

485
00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:48.719
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): So, our analysis framework.

486
00:49:49.550 --> 00:49:54.530
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Well, can I ask a quick question about the integration part of it? Yeah. So, while Zendesk is retiring.

487
00:49:54.870 --> 00:50:02.979
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Are we able to integrate Zendesk before it retires and save all that data down, or do we have to just give all that up when Zendesk goes away?

488
00:50:02.985 --> 00:50:04.604
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): any other export mechanisms?

489
00:50:04.605 --> 00:50:07.465
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): You can export the entire…

490
00:50:07.465 --> 00:50:09.334
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): CSV, and then there's a lot…

491
00:50:09.340 --> 00:50:11.279
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): Which is a further comment. Okay.

492
00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:15.030
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Yeah, import it and tag it. Okay, no.

493
00:50:15.330 --> 00:50:20.539
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Okay, so current state assessment, objectives and strategy, functional and technical requirements. So we already kind of

494
00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:25.460
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): I've been touching it on the current state assessment. I think we're starting to get an understanding of how you guys

495
00:50:25.610 --> 00:50:32.639
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): are operating from a marketing and CRM perspective. Primarily… primarily, your opportunities are coming from influencers.

496
00:50:32.930 --> 00:50:37.699
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): And then… Sales account managers are entering the opportunities.

497
00:50:37.700 --> 00:50:44.219
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Depends. If it's new, it's usually the salesperson. If it's reoccurring business, it's the account manager.

498
00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:47.080
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Okay, well, that makes… okay, that makes sense, yep. Salesperson.

499
00:50:47.085 --> 00:50:50.365
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): being business development. Yep. Yeah, definitely not anything new.

500
00:50:51.070 --> 00:50:54.879
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): That's the, hunter Farmer? Yeah, right?

501
00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:56.790
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): Exactly. Is that accurate? Yeah.

502
00:50:58.250 --> 00:50:59.510
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): And then.

503
00:51:00.630 --> 00:51:01.300
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): How?

504
00:51:01.990 --> 00:51:07.339
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): in the CRM, Right now, we've talked about activities. They're doing some inside the system.

505
00:51:07.810 --> 00:51:11.699
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): How come other people aren't doing it in the system? If you could.

506
00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:13.820
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): LS.

507
00:51:13.825 --> 00:51:17.494
Jill Marsh: I think the… again, GMs, you can…

508
00:51:18.005 --> 00:51:20.965
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): say, but…

509
00:51:21.265 --> 00:51:26.845
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): if you are productive, I guess is the word we could say, as far as volume, then…

510
00:51:27.605 --> 00:51:33.834
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): rules can look different. So, if you're really successful and you're only putting in a first name and not a last name.

511
00:51:33.945 --> 00:51:48.065
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I'd be okay with that, because you're still winning a lot of business. So, the… we're not so hard and fast on rules when it comes to… if you're not doing a very good job, then yeah, the rules get much more complicated. Yeah, that makes sense. But is that a fair acquisition, like, statement?

512
00:51:48.420 --> 00:51:57.399
Jill Marsh: Yeah, I mean, we're not… I would say information's not getting put in for, one, people don't want other people to see their stuff.

513
00:51:57.670 --> 00:51:58.229
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I forgot about that.

514
00:51:58.230 --> 00:51:59.299
Jill Marsh: plot out, like.

515
00:51:59.300 --> 00:51:59.939
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): There's no way.

516
00:51:59.940 --> 00:52:00.750
Jill Marsh: Competition.

517
00:52:00.750 --> 00:52:02.280
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): visibility isn't gonna assume.

518
00:52:02.620 --> 00:52:04.760
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): That's right.

519
00:52:04.765 --> 00:52:09.564
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So, in Zendesk, if you have a user account, you can use… so you can see everything in Zendesk.

520
00:52:10.105 --> 00:52:10.624
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): So we can…

521
00:52:10.630 --> 00:52:11.140
Jill Marsh: That was…

522
00:52:11.140 --> 00:52:14.870
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Restricted their opportunities to only the ones that they're on.

523
00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:16.510
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): It does that natively.

524
00:52:16.510 --> 00:52:18.440
Jill Marsh: That was a question I had, okay.

525
00:52:18.440 --> 00:52:23.090
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): But that… why that kind of becomes a little bit complicated is we use it also

526
00:52:24.610 --> 00:52:30.200
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Someone, if they hear about something, is supposed to look if someone else has already…

527
00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:30.550
Jill Marsh: Right.

528
00:52:30.550 --> 00:52:33.160
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): The question is, is can you…

529
00:52:33.780 --> 00:52:36.639
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): pick and choose what they can see, or is it all our content?

530
00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:41.390
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So, like, can you see that the account exists, but you don't have the contacts that are associated with it?

531
00:52:41.390 --> 00:52:42.890
Jill Marsh: That was my question, yeah.

532
00:52:43.060 --> 00:52:47.620
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Because we have some people that are hunting with… within the homestead.

533
00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:52.029
Alex Blangeres: way to put in that.

534
00:52:52.035 --> 00:52:54.875
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): So, are they, like, sharky? People's…

535
00:52:55.525 --> 00:52:59.165
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yeah, or they come up with a reason of why it should be theirs.

536
00:52:59.495 --> 00:53:00.445
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): They are.

537
00:53:01.180 --> 00:53:07.649
Jill Marsh: You know, they know one influencer, and someone else knows the other influencer, and so then it just gets really muddy.

538
00:53:08.010 --> 00:53:19.640
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Which has also made it difficult, because the lack of information can be a strategy, but also it's a strategy that can work against you, because we always did… we always have said, well, whoever shows the most

539
00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:42.029
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): about a deal, it's gonna default going to that person. So if you can show activity and contact and outreach, and someone else comes over and says, no, no, that should be mine, it's like, well, prove it. This person has all of this documented. But then they're afraid to document it, because then the other person will start counterattacking and, like, calling people, and then it creates some market nonsense.

540
00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:44.669
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Is there some… okay.

541
00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:53.429
Alex Blangeres: Yeah, on Zendesk, there was a whole feed, and there'd be people monitoring that feed of activity.

542
00:53:53.430 --> 00:54:04.300
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): That's insane. Wow. There is a company-wide feed, and it will show you every change that is made to every op chain. It's like an activity feed. Yeah, so you can just sit there and doom-scroll through something.

543
00:54:04.630 --> 00:54:06.550
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Zendesk if you wanted to.

544
00:54:06.555 --> 00:54:09.805
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): It's funny, actually. That's legislative.

545
00:54:09.805 --> 00:54:12.835
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): It's cultural. It's a full-time.

546
00:54:12.835 --> 00:54:13.945
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): Good job!

547
00:54:13.950 --> 00:54:14.440
Alex Blangeres: Yeah.

548
00:54:15.020 --> 00:54:22.210
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I mean, they're compensated to be… Aggressive. Aggressive, and therefore, they're paranoid. Yeah. Yeah.

549
00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:26.159
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Is there anything that we can do to help with that?

550
00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:28.020
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Therapist?

551
00:54:28.020 --> 00:54:28.430
Alex Blangeres: I mean, I think.

552
00:54:28.430 --> 00:54:34.060
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Starting by not being, like, limiting view is helpful. Yeah.

553
00:54:34.170 --> 00:54:39.349
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Don't create a thread that shows everything that's ever happening in Zend… or in NextWeek.

554
00:54:40.530 --> 00:54:50.390
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Yep, we'll do that. We can… we can limit it to… you can only see what opportunities are yours that are assigned to you. You can't see other people's opportunities.

555
00:54:50.390 --> 00:54:59.630
Alex Blangeres: I'm curious about, like, edit permissions as well. Like, does everyone have the ability to go in and edit, or make changes, or delete?

556
00:55:00.680 --> 00:55:03.260
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): That's easy until the legislation.

557
00:55:04.360 --> 00:55:09.220
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Yeah, because right now, anyone can do it and send it out. Did you say the duplicate,

558
00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:13.969
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): Watching for duplicates is done in the lead stage as well.

559
00:55:14.100 --> 00:55:15.820
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): Because that's what we see. We're on that.

560
00:55:15.825 --> 00:55:19.584
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): We're on three things, let's take them one at a time. Well, I was just thinking that.

561
00:55:19.585 --> 00:55:25.584
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): that that would help with the visit, but one of the reasons that we've opened up visibility is to avoid it, you know what I mean?

562
00:55:25.585 --> 00:55:33.154
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yeah, my last company that we were on Salesforce had a due blocker, so I'd let you enter everything, and then it would have to go into approval status.

563
00:55:33.375 --> 00:55:40.075
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And then the system would go out and look for similar, you know, if it found similar, it would deny.

564
00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:42.039
Jill Marsh: Yeah, I mean, that's a good.

565
00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:48.759
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Something similar, but they don't deny it, they just, they give you the option right then to merge it, if you have permissions to merge.

566
00:55:48.765 --> 00:55:52.505
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Or then what we also see is, like, you know.

567
00:55:52.705 --> 00:55:57.535
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Daniel McCleary all of a sudden becomes Dan McCleary, and it, like, runs it through.

568
00:55:57.785 --> 00:56:06.785
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): It's the problem with leads, it's the wild what? People are creating these on the fly, it's not… it's not querying, I mean, it's… you're not just opening the existing customer account.

569
00:56:06.785 --> 00:56:23.375
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Yeah, we can have another conversation about duplicate detection, for sure, but as far as, like, the sales people, so we can limit it, you can edit your own, but you can't edit others. You can view your own, but you can't view others, so we can do that. You could probably come up with some other solutions on the duplicate detection side to help with that.

570
00:56:23.610 --> 00:56:25.720
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): But then I guess when you… when there's…

571
00:56:26.100 --> 00:56:34.439
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Their managers, when you're meeting with them, if they both come to you in separate meetings with the same opportunity, you would be notified at that point that you have a conflict.

572
00:56:34.440 --> 00:56:50.840
Jill Marsh: Well, because I was gonna say, that's the one thing, Kate had mentioned this earlier, that we do ask of our business developers, is when they find out about a new lead, the very first thing you're supposed to do is go look in Zendesk and see if somebody else has it, so that way we can have a conversation.

573
00:56:51.980 --> 00:56:56.220
Jill Marsh: So, if we are hiding things, it sort of prevents that from…

574
00:56:57.060 --> 00:57:00.399
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Well, maybe we start with not hiding, but no editing.

575
00:57:01.940 --> 00:57:03.159
Jill Marsh: Or even if it's…

576
00:57:03.690 --> 00:57:05.270
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yeah, or just, like, the D…

577
00:57:05.270 --> 00:57:05.620
Jill Marsh: film.

578
00:57:05.620 --> 00:57:14.880
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): If they're not getting updates about it, then maybe they won't have… the amount of looking they'd have to go do would be too time-consuming, because right now it's easy, it's very easy.

579
00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:15.610
Jill Marsh: Yeah.

580
00:57:16.780 --> 00:57:28.719
Jill Marsh: I do think that not having that activity thread visible, though, is for sure helpful, because then you can't see, like, oh, look, someone just added this, or like, oh, they put a comment on this and changed it, and…

581
00:57:28.940 --> 00:57:29.490
Jill Marsh: So…

582
00:57:29.490 --> 00:57:31.750
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Look at it right now, there's a ton of information.

583
00:57:32.100 --> 00:57:32.780
Jill Marsh: Yeah.

584
00:57:33.580 --> 00:57:40.399
Jill Marsh: So… And the stuff we do want shown on that activity thread does not show… get shown.

585
00:57:41.070 --> 00:57:43.260
Jill Marsh: Which is… frustrating, so…

586
00:57:43.260 --> 00:57:45.060
Alex Blangeres: Right.

587
00:57:45.060 --> 00:57:57.470
Jill Marsh: Like, we want to know when someone had a $1 million deal, and all of a sudden it got value engineered, and now it's a $800,000 deal. Like, we have no way of seeing that.

588
00:57:58.540 --> 00:58:14.620
Jill Marsh: and tracking that, and that's one thing that we've asked Zendesk, is we'd love to be able to see a volume change, or if there was an order that was supposed to book in… it was going to order in January, and then we pushed it to February, we also don't…

589
00:58:14.830 --> 00:58:20.430
Jill Marsh: That doesn't show up in the activity feed, so the things we want to be able to see that change don't show up.

590
00:58:21.050 --> 00:58:22.530
Jill Marsh: And things that…

591
00:58:23.100 --> 00:58:32.540
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Do that? Like, are account managers the ones who are responsible for once they know that a project volume has changed, they're supposed to go in and change it? Yes. Okay.

592
00:58:32.545 --> 00:58:33.485
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): I'm mute. Okay.

593
00:58:33.490 --> 00:58:40.469
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): So we don't have an activity fee, but we can give you those on your dashboard as simple queries. Perfect. You can have visibility onto that.

594
00:58:40.630 --> 00:58:42.199
Jill Marsh: Perfect, that's great.

595
00:58:42.200 --> 00:58:43.400
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Anthony?

596
00:58:43.700 --> 00:58:46.250
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): That actually affects me. I don't use.

597
00:58:46.380 --> 00:58:49.930
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): See? So… It's called… Activity Feed.

598
00:58:51.360 --> 00:58:53.149
Cornerstone: So you can turn that off.

599
00:58:54.370 --> 00:58:55.980
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): Didn't cut mine off the coast in it.

600
00:58:56.820 --> 00:59:06.620
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): It sounds like there's two pieces of it, yeah. So, I think for… for us, we'll plan on… what were the… what were the two, things? Volume change, or what was the other one?

601
00:59:07.250 --> 00:59:09.110
Alex Blangeres: I could change, or…

602
00:59:09.830 --> 00:59:11.099
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): Yeah, closed, it's the close.

603
00:59:11.105 --> 00:59:11.645
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): phrase.

604
00:59:11.645 --> 00:59:13.715
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): The expected close date? Yeah, something he'll.

605
00:59:13.715 --> 00:59:34.155
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): to think about on the editing side is related to what I just said about the account manager. So, like, the salesperson, the business developer will enter the lead, but then it will eventually get transitioned over to an account manager to manage that, and so those editing permissions would need to change, so it's not just the first person who is

606
00:59:34.355 --> 00:59:36.214
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Entering the information.

607
00:59:36.215 --> 00:59:39.334
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Any resource, probably, on the opportunity app.

608
00:59:39.505 --> 00:59:40.314
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Got it.

609
00:59:43.570 --> 00:59:51.989
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Yeah, so I think the way we would handle it is they would become a sales rep on their community. So, we have a sales team, and so if the

610
00:59:52.300 --> 01:00:00.430
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): the BD rep is the first sales team member, and then with… Yeah, the ad people, that's when the handover happens, and then they have permissions.

611
01:00:02.870 --> 01:00:04.829
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): That's actually right.

612
01:00:04.830 --> 01:00:07.099
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Well, somebody else could add it, I don't know who…

613
01:00:07.105 --> 01:00:09.365
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): I almost have to go in and…

614
01:00:09.365 --> 01:00:23.805
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Yeah, because the… and in all fairness, like, BD's job is to hunt, so bog them down with, like, administrative tasks. It's just… it's not gonna work, it doesn't work, it's never worked. They have to kill over.

615
01:00:23.810 --> 01:00:24.330
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Yeah.

616
01:00:24.330 --> 01:00:25.170
Alex Blangeres: They just…

617
01:00:25.170 --> 01:00:43.799
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): And also, that's not where their time should be spent, so that's why it has to be easy for someone else to do it, but then also, it shouldn't necessarily fall on the GMs, who have also a crazy workload, so they have their own business development initiatives and are managing these entire offices. So there has to be some sort of process in place for who's doing it.

618
01:00:43.805 --> 01:00:44.585
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): I apologize.

619
01:00:44.585 --> 01:00:46.845
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): That's the first part of this conversation, doing what?

620
01:00:46.845 --> 01:00:47.625
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): It was the…

621
01:00:47.625 --> 01:00:48.355
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): volunteer.

622
01:00:48.355 --> 01:01:04.804
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Yeah, because a VD will enter the lead, but then when the project turns over to an account manager, the account manager goes in and adds themselves now in Zendesk, but this team will have to figure out how to look through that from an editing standpoint.

623
01:01:04.805 --> 01:01:18.325
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Well, I would imagine it would be the same, where we're only talking about sales not having editable access for things that they're not part of. Account management wouldn't have different access. Yeah, so… So we would just have different access levels based off of roles.

624
01:01:18.325 --> 01:01:31.095
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Got it, okay, that's what Kimmy was saying, is that the BD person is very unlikely to add their team at the time, because also their team could be assigned later. They don't know when that is. Yeah. So, it's just like…

625
01:01:31.340 --> 01:01:45.239
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): That's fine. Because, like, when something moves from a lead into an opportunity, we're gonna start assigning roles and tasks. So design, like, the design request form, then we're gonna assign design, and so on, and so on, and so on. So what we now use in resources

626
01:01:45.580 --> 01:01:54.240
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): and Core, we would do the same thing, but whatever it's called for NetSuite, and we wouldn't have to do it in two places, because it's all going to be in NetSuite. Yeah.

627
01:01:55.140 --> 01:02:03.180
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): A couple things you said I just want to make sure we have documented from the transcript. So, your pipeline report or your forecast report is only 70% or greater.

628
01:02:03.750 --> 01:02:07.149
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): As far as, like, the forecast report, or… yes.

629
01:02:07.660 --> 01:02:14.780
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): So, the list of your opportunity statuses, there's a probability associated with each status, is that correct?

630
01:02:14.785 --> 01:02:26.084
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): is when it was in Salesforce, they were linked. Zendesk does not link them. Okay. So, you have to change the probability status and the probability percentage, but it pulls the report off the probability percentage.

631
01:02:26.085 --> 01:02:27.955
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): Toby, are you good with it being?

632
01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:30.660
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): Again, yes, right?

633
01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:31.360
Alex Blangeres: Yes.

634
01:02:31.790 --> 01:02:37.690
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): But, so… Who has the current list of statuses?

635
01:02:38.390 --> 01:02:43.850
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Any… anybody in this room? Can somebody take the action item, send them to us?

636
01:02:44.285 --> 01:02:45.574
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): in the text.

637
01:02:45.575 --> 01:02:48.025
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): substances to… The…

638
01:02:48.025 --> 01:02:52.314
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): And then the follow-up question there is, are you guys looking to change that at all? Are you good with it?

639
01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:54.680
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): But that's thankful.

640
01:02:54.910 --> 01:02:55.950
Alex Blangeres: I think it's fine.

641
01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:57.589
Jill Marsh: I think it's fine, too.

642
01:02:58.010 --> 01:03:01.420
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): And it can be changed at any time, we just want to load it in. Honestly.

643
01:03:01.425 --> 01:03:05.355
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Though, actually, there's probably one that we could change, because I think there's… oh, no.

644
01:03:05.655 --> 01:03:06.645
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Took it out.

645
01:03:07.210 --> 01:03:07.810
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): Yeah.

646
01:03:08.550 --> 01:03:22.009
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): That's good. It's LEAD RFP Awarded Programming Proposal Presented, on hold, order one, unqualified or closed loss, which… I don't know if we need unqualified.

647
01:03:23.780 --> 01:03:26.239
Jill Marsh: Yeah, I've never used it or seen it yet.

648
01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:30.400
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): from the lead, and if it's unqualified, I actually just delete it.

649
01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:33.880
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Well, so that… Because it's cleaning!

650
01:03:33.885 --> 01:03:37.624
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): quote, I don't need a whole database of cleaning quote requests. Right.

651
01:03:37.625 --> 01:03:41.915
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): It's the only one that we don't need as unqualified, because that is a lead.

652
01:03:42.125 --> 01:03:43.005
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Right?

653
01:03:43.510 --> 01:03:46.610
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Jill, that goes back to my throwing everything away tendencies, sorry.

654
01:03:46.610 --> 01:03:49.519
Jill Marsh: Yeah, I know. Like, Matt, what did you throw?

655
01:03:49.550 --> 01:03:50.580
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): the question.

656
01:03:51.060 --> 01:03:52.560
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Sorry.

657
01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:55.510
Jill Marsh: Unqualified, I don't think we need, also, I agree.

658
01:03:56.260 --> 01:03:56.919
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Back to you.

659
01:03:58.330 --> 01:04:00.730
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): But it really just comes down to lead. Right.

660
01:04:00.730 --> 01:04:02.380
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): It is kind of unqualified. Yeah.

661
01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:09.609
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Can it stay? If it's the league, can the unqualified stay, and it moves to an opportunity, that goes away? Or are they all the same…

662
01:04:10.190 --> 01:04:11.370
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Options.

663
01:04:12.660 --> 01:04:14.799
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): Not the same options.

664
01:04:15.850 --> 01:04:20.990
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So I think unqualified's fine if we're talking about a league, if we're talking about an opportunity, that would have existed there.

665
01:04:23.140 --> 01:04:25.350
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So, let's say the two lists.

666
01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:30.080
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): One for lead and one for opportunity. One is for questions, Jillian.

667
01:04:30.085 --> 01:04:44.585
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): The question is about the qualification, actually, and so this comes up just in terms of thinking about resources and future planning and thinking about sectors, and then some of the data that our team's looking at, just on the RFP front, with, like.

668
01:04:44.765 --> 01:04:54.845
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): what's effective for us, where are we winning, who are we winning with, like, internally? And I… but we don't really have a way of tracking projects

669
01:04:55.285 --> 01:05:10.334
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): that are really not good fits for us, where we put this, like, time and energy and resources, and it's, like, just a loan return. And I don't know if that's a valuable metric that we should look at, so that in the future.

670
01:05:10.515 --> 01:05:15.584
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Moving, and we can say no thank you to that, and we have a data point.

671
01:05:16.165 --> 01:05:27.695
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): I don't think that we can control that in this, because if you ask the salesperson… Oh, they'll always say everything's alright. Right, so then giving it… I don't think that's part of this. Okay, right, you're right, right, okay.

672
01:05:28.890 --> 01:05:29.590
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Thank you.

673
01:05:30.490 --> 01:05:33.200
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): I think that's part of a separate topic. Yes. Yeah.

674
01:05:34.645 --> 01:05:40.015
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): let's just talk about the activities real quick in NetSuite. We have, events, tasks.

675
01:05:40.675 --> 01:05:44.744
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): You can time track with tasks, you can time track on the opportunity as well.

676
01:05:44.935 --> 01:05:55.105
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Email, messaging right inside the system as well, and documentation, so you can have files. But the other thing is we have Outlook integration.

677
01:05:55.625 --> 01:06:01.774
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): buffer this as well. It's a pretty cool outlook integration, so… but are you guys using Gmail? No. Oh, so you are using Gmail.

678
01:06:03.725 --> 01:06:07.765
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): So, the Outlook… why don't you take a minute to talk about the Outlook integration in the show?

679
01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:09.930
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): Thanks, Eddie.

680
01:06:10.190 --> 01:06:13.800
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): So the Outlook integration, basically.

681
01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:15.110
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): Okay.

682
01:06:15.110 --> 01:06:15.630
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Either one.

683
01:06:15.635 --> 01:06:16.305
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): off.

684
01:06:16.310 --> 01:06:17.770
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): Or, totally randomly.

685
01:06:18.050 --> 01:06:20.359
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): create records within NetSuite.

686
01:06:20.690 --> 01:06:26.860
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): something comes in, and it is in any way able to be tied directly to NetSuite will update that worker to create new records.

687
01:06:26.865 --> 01:06:28.414
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): And it's flown out.

688
01:06:28.565 --> 01:06:29.155
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): inside.

689
01:06:29.155 --> 01:06:31.075
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): customer management, whatever it is.

690
01:06:31.345 --> 01:06:33.305
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): directional.

691
01:06:33.305 --> 01:06:39.304
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): And then you can set it on autopilot, where anything comes into that thread will automatically be captured in that suite.

692
01:06:39.305 --> 01:06:40.045
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): But also.

693
01:06:40.050 --> 01:06:42.300
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): Check whether you email how to.

694
01:06:42.305 --> 01:06:46.954
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): NetSuite or on VolleyBook. You can track that entire conversation thread in NetSuite.

695
01:06:46.955 --> 01:06:51.545
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): So, if someone goes on vacation, you want to see what conversations have been.

696
01:06:51.545 --> 01:06:54.304
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): And beforehand, you can see all that in that suite.

697
01:06:54.485 --> 01:07:13.075
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): There's also… there's a SharePoint, and we're double-checking on the Google Drive integration, where you're setting up your entire folder structure there, you drag and drop into it, and then, the calendar sync between Outlook and NetSuite as well. So you can schedule an activity in NetSuite down the show, now the calendar.

698
01:07:14.010 --> 01:07:16.599
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Is context part of that? Because then there's local.

699
01:07:16.810 --> 01:07:22.570
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): So then you have next week, contacts that we're also trying to…

700
01:07:22.770 --> 01:07:27.119
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): CRM portion that are also tied to Google development content.

701
01:07:28.290 --> 01:07:35.230
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Oh, it's not actually the contacts record in Outlook, but you can… you can create a,

702
01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:36.950
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): Alright, cool.

703
01:07:38.380 --> 01:07:41.339
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): That's just COVID. Yeah.

704
01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:45.460
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): implemented.

705
01:07:48.680 --> 01:07:52.430
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): But you can create a contact, break them out with them.

706
01:07:53.230 --> 01:07:54.240
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): In NetSuite.

707
01:07:54.900 --> 01:08:03.360
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): So, like, if, you get an email from somebody, and… That's a new one. That's new, yeah, you could say, okay, go ahead and create this contact, and that's right from Outlook.

708
01:08:03.585 --> 01:08:07.235
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): Okay. And tie it directly to the company. Yep.

709
01:08:08.190 --> 01:08:13.479
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): So, there's some short… there's just some nice, convenient shortcuts, yeah. Are there any Big Brother vibes to this?

710
01:08:13.485 --> 01:08:15.075
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): or no?

711
01:08:15.405 --> 01:08:18.284
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Well, I think it has to be limited of who can actually look at…

712
01:08:18.505 --> 01:08:34.145
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): I think that's, like, an editing thing. I can see where, because we've had to do this in the past, someone's on PTO, someone's on leave, someone's out, and I have to reach out to KIP or our IT people and be like, hey, can I have access to their email? I need to look at…

713
01:08:34.145 --> 01:08:40.144
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): You should not use your work email for personal things, because I can log into your email at any moment I want to.

714
01:08:40.145 --> 01:08:49.515
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): I don't think it's about the personal side of it, but I'm just on the human side of it, just knowing how people behave and react to those things, thinking about it from a change management standpoint.

715
01:08:49.885 --> 01:09:07.004
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): I think that internally, we would get a lot of pushback for that, especially from the sales team. Like, it would… it could force behavior where people are having separate conversations outside of their outlook, you know, because they don't want to be tracked, and I think that that's a very likely outcome with some of our sensitive people.

716
01:09:07.005 --> 01:09:19.834
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Are they just getting to opt-in what they want trained? I don't know, that's what I'm trying to… I'm, like, I'm gonna send this email for a specific opportunity to show activity, so I'm linking it. It's not just taking a full log of your entire email.

717
01:09:19.835 --> 01:09:27.245
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): That's what I was interpreting, just based on the, okay, if they're out, you can go and look at what happened before and after.

718
01:09:27.245 --> 01:09:36.795
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Okay. And in fact, like, some of them have actually complained that it doesn't link right now, because they'd like to be able to track that activity within the system.

719
01:09:36.984 --> 01:09:56.555
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And I would assume that same integration is going to happen for, like, our project coordinators. If they want to attach an email they sent about a warranty claim within a project, they'll be able to do that. But it's their choice to link it or not link it to that specific email thread. Thanks for clarifying. Hi, Jill!

720
01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:57.480
Alex Blangeres: Hi, Chill!

721
01:09:58.300 --> 01:10:00.760
Jill Marsh: Bye.

722
01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:06.109
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): So you have the Outlook integration, where you can, from in Outlook, say, hey.

723
01:10:06.250 --> 01:10:22.950
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): attach this to, you know, this email to an opportunity, or start tracking this conversation, but if you initiate a conversation from within NetSuite, because you can generate email inside of NetSuite, you initiate the conversation there, the customer replies, it's automatically tracked in NetSuite. So it'll show up in your Outlook and in NetSuite.

724
01:10:22.970 --> 01:10:26.410
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): So it's… you're really covered. The idea here is.

725
01:10:27.090 --> 01:10:31.220
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): As you mentioned, the benefit of having, you know, visibility on the email communication.

726
01:10:31.370 --> 01:10:38.500
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): But also, for email communication, events, tasks, whatever, you can build automation off of all of that.

727
01:10:39.740 --> 01:10:41.589
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Sorry, we're getting home…

728
01:10:41.890 --> 01:10:56.919
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yeah, because then that would limit, like, if it was… if they were tagging correspondents that were specific to a project, when they do go on PTO, we wouldn't need to access their old email file, because we would have the email specific to that project. Yeah.

729
01:10:58.950 --> 01:11:06.299
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): And you can tie it to any record in NetSuite that you want to specifically, and it's like, only track the stuff on this particular sales order.

730
01:11:06.925 --> 01:11:19.765
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): How is the storage volume of all, like, if we have a power user that is just linking every single email they've ever sent in their entire life, like, are we paying at some point for volume?

731
01:11:19.895 --> 01:11:28.824
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): as far as storage, like, I have to assume that eats up cloud space on some server in some buildings and snow books.

732
01:11:29.660 --> 01:11:40.910
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): So, from the… the Outlook… well, on the Outlook side, you have your… yeah. Inside NetSuite, NetSuite does track your file cabinet.

733
01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:48.699
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): And you have to get 100 gigabytes. Okay. So they technically could start charging you, but they never charge you.

734
01:11:48.705 --> 01:11:52.465
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): 100 gigabytes per user, or total? Total. Well, that's not very much.

735
01:11:52.465 --> 01:11:55.595
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): It's not… which is one of the reasons why we have the SharePoint integration.

736
01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:58.049
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Right, because we could fill that, like, 40 times over the email.

737
01:11:58.050 --> 01:11:59.979
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): No accounts against the Fonkins.

738
01:12:00.790 --> 01:12:04.929
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Oh, yeah, because it's like a subtle record. See, is there a way that we would…

739
01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:18.920
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): I mean, this is sort of a little bit separate than email, but on an opportunity that we require people, like, let's say the contract has to be uploaded and attached to that opportunity. Any of the POs that are cut have to be.

740
01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:33.850
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Because right now, like, we don't use Val Cabinet and Core, which drives me nuts, because basically we print 50 POs, and then we save them down to another folder. Right. And I'd love for that to just be in one place.

741
01:12:35.020 --> 01:12:36.059
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): Yeah, so the way you're.

742
01:12:36.060 --> 01:12:38.729
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): It's actually two different things. One of them would hit.

743
01:12:38.730 --> 01:12:44.830
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): the file cabinet or the storage place, and one wouldn't… like, a PO is automatically going to be the one. There's, like, a highway between them.

744
01:12:44.830 --> 01:12:45.460
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): And all of the.

745
01:12:45.460 --> 01:12:46.200
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): Right, yeah.

746
01:12:46.205 --> 01:12:51.474
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): There's nothing… there's not really a file to link, because you're just looking at it in real life. Right.

747
01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:52.479
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): The other.

748
01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:52.950
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): was.

749
01:12:52.950 --> 01:12:54.080
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): a contract.

750
01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:56.699
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): So it's a PDF of the contract. Right. That would…

751
01:12:56.930 --> 01:13:03.190
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): hit storage, but what we're saying is we're going to integrate with Google Drive, and it's just represented in NetSuite.

752
01:13:03.370 --> 01:13:04.580
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): It's not… it doesn't actually…

753
01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:06.499
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): live in NetSuite. Yeah.

754
01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:07.200
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): So…

755
01:13:07.205 --> 01:13:07.934
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): As long as you're Google.

756
01:13:07.940 --> 01:13:10.939
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Maybe we'll move it to DocuSign, I don't know.

757
01:13:10.945 --> 01:13:13.205
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): sharing a file path, is what you're describing.

758
01:13:13.915 --> 01:13:15.595
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): It's like, how many…

759
01:13:16.205 --> 01:13:16.964
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): No, I guess.

760
01:13:16.965 --> 01:13:17.705
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): position by shirt.

761
01:13:17.710 --> 01:13:19.179
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): That's what happened.

762
01:13:19.185 --> 01:13:23.705
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): to, so you don't have to use SharePoint at all, except inside that speak.

763
01:13:23.705 --> 01:13:29.325
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): then that's something we could definitely turn on, if it's just files that live within that trajectory to keep us out of the 100…

764
01:13:29.685 --> 01:13:30.695
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): Yes, yeah.

765
01:13:30.700 --> 01:13:32.079
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): That's the idea of under.

766
01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:32.689
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): That's a problem.

767
01:13:32.690 --> 01:13:47.970
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): when we had two drives, because we had Box and we had Google, is that then we started having two sets of client records, because of all the Google Docs that we use for everything. So that's why we went to one. But if it's just stuff that's going to live within NetSuite, then yeah, that could live on SharePoint, because we're already paying for SharePoint, right? Yep.

768
01:13:48.730 --> 01:13:52.459
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): That would be the ideal state. Okay, the integration is strongly restricted.

769
01:13:52.460 --> 01:14:02.590
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): But then I could still have somewhere that would allow me to insert links back to Google Drive for easy connection. If somebody's in NetSuite and they want to go straight to that Google Drive, they could just click a link.

770
01:14:02.890 --> 01:14:05.799
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Within the project custom fields, is that?

771
01:14:05.805 --> 01:14:08.005
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): Yeah, that could not be hyperlinked, no.

772
01:14:08.010 --> 01:14:09.350
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yeah. Okay.

773
01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:10.839
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yep, very easy.

774
01:14:11.820 --> 01:14:16.619
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Do you guys have the concept of quotas for sales goals? Yes.

775
01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:18.350
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): How do you manage those?

776
01:14:19.130 --> 01:14:22.779
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Well, Kip, would you like to shine on the bookings?

777
01:14:22.780 --> 01:14:23.360
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): Okay.

778
01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:24.070
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): report.

779
01:14:24.070 --> 01:14:27.059
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): They don't get managed in CORE, I can tell you that.

780
01:14:27.065 --> 01:14:40.095
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): It's a customer report that I had built and core built for us. It's dumped, it's CSV file, dumped into this super complicated Excel file that I created, and it's updated and

781
01:14:40.785 --> 01:14:45.134
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): It's been pushed out to everyone once a week. You can see variances on time.

782
01:14:46.780 --> 01:14:48.749
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): Because it doesn't match up, it doesn't line up.

783
01:14:48.750 --> 01:14:51.740
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Okay. Yeah, it's like a screenshot in time, yeah.

784
01:14:51.745 --> 01:15:07.135
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): It breaks out all sales by salesperson, by account manager resources, then by office, then by total, and then shows each week what the booking was, what the total is, and then what the year is, and then what percent of goal we are at sales and in GP.

785
01:15:07.900 --> 01:15:18.859
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Got it. And so the sales goal gets sent to, say, annual goal? So the annual goal. Do you ever recalibrate it, like, quarterly or anything like that? No. So just one time? Yep. Oh, nice and easy. You're either good.

786
01:15:18.865 --> 01:15:21.865
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Or you're getting over it, or you're not getting anywhere near it.

787
01:15:21.865 --> 01:15:24.365
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Does any of that affect their commission?

788
01:15:25.010 --> 01:15:26.180
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yeah, I mean, they're all…

789
01:15:26.430 --> 01:15:34.739
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): But, no, there's not a change in rate. Okay. You're either making money, you're not. If you're not selling anything, you're not getting commission. If you're selling something, you're getting commission. Okay, I just didn't know if there was a good.

790
01:15:34.745 --> 01:15:36.065
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Oh my god, it's been…

791
01:15:36.825 --> 01:15:37.584
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): I've got it.

792
01:15:37.585 --> 01:15:39.064
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): to interrupt you.

793
01:15:39.065 --> 01:15:39.825
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): That's it.

794
01:15:39.825 --> 01:15:42.985
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): You know, there's… there it is. There it is.

795
01:15:44.970 --> 01:15:53.160
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I think we made it really nice. I insisted on the progress bars last year.

796
01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:54.480
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): You want that to live in NetSuite?

797
01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:58.220
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yes. Yes. Okay, and we want it to be a… just a dashboard. Yep.

798
01:15:58.225 --> 01:16:01.225
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): dashboard, living in NetSuite, and I imagine you…

799
01:16:01.225 --> 01:16:11.464
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): like an executive view versus an everyday person view. Yeah, so everybody gets to… Because what we publish to the company does not show by office, it just shows the company.

800
01:16:11.725 --> 01:16:15.165
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): No, you can see, like, the email set off yet? No, you can't.

801
01:16:15.530 --> 01:16:18.780
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): You used to be able to, but now you… You only see the total.

802
01:16:18.785 --> 01:16:20.005
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): Really?

803
01:16:20.005 --> 01:16:23.805
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): You see a condensed version.

804
01:16:24.225 --> 01:16:37.625
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Because apparently we were creating… you can still see director and account. Oh, okay, yeah, yeah. I can't see by office. Okay. Because apparently we were creating competition between the offices, which I love.

805
01:16:38.490 --> 01:16:44.560
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): I don't know, so it doesn't… no, it doesn't make sense, trust me. It causes problems for us.

806
01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:45.800
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): And why do you think Matt Life.

807
01:16:45.805 --> 01:16:49.644
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): To see the, my office. Yeah. I wonder.

808
01:16:49.650 --> 01:16:52.660
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Well, no, I'm not part of any of this.

809
01:16:52.665 --> 01:16:55.625
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): But what I'm saying is, like…

810
01:16:55.625 --> 01:16:59.774
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Just for the sake of the transcript, we'll have a requirement to…

811
01:16:59.885 --> 01:17:09.164
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Create the sales goals. Do you call them goals or quotas? Goals. Goals, sales goals, sign NetSuite. I will get with Kib to get a spreadsheet, and have that recreated inside the platform.

812
01:17:09.395 --> 01:17:19.375
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Well, I guess also, this should go back to our conversation around all report check-ins. Is this still valid, what we need, or do we need to manipulate it in any way?

813
01:17:19.585 --> 01:17:24.165
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Okay, because I don't want to just recreate for the sake of recreating. This one had very low.

814
01:17:24.165 --> 01:17:26.715
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): feedback, because everybody loves it, so… Okay.

815
01:17:27.240 --> 01:17:34.720
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Your pipeline reporting, or your forecast reporting, you said 70% and above. Are you looking at primarily revenue, or looking at GP dollars, or both?

816
01:17:35.630 --> 01:17:39.789
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Well, in the forecasting environment, we're just looking at revenue. Yeah.

817
01:17:39.990 --> 01:17:44.259
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Okay, where's the GP dollars come into play? That's the opportunity…

818
01:17:44.860 --> 01:17:47.499
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): On the last… On the booking, yeah.

819
01:17:47.505 --> 01:17:48.055
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Got it.

820
01:17:48.550 --> 01:17:51.259
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): When we're forecasting, we don't have GB. They have the…

821
01:17:51.265 --> 01:17:58.235
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): to put it in, it's not a required field. We don't look at it for the forecast. We're focused on revenue. We have annual.

822
01:17:58.240 --> 01:17:58.859
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): GP goal.

823
01:17:59.450 --> 01:18:02.940
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Like, we have a revenue goal and a GP goal every year.

824
01:18:02.940 --> 01:18:03.400
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): But when I…

825
01:18:03.405 --> 01:18:05.525
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): It comes with forecast. Right, right.

826
01:18:05.525 --> 01:18:12.294
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): forecasting. Yeah, and that's based on booking? Yes. Then the forecast is just revenue based on opportunity total.

827
01:18:12.865 --> 01:18:15.264
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Okay, so we do have the GP, kind of.

828
01:18:15.515 --> 01:18:18.764
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): the target GP on the opportunity, do you guys even want that?

829
01:18:18.765 --> 01:18:25.495
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yeah, we have a target GP goal, which is 22%. Okay. For the whole year.

830
01:18:25.785 --> 01:18:37.685
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So, you know, Google's not gonna let us sell to them at 22%. Right. But somebody else might let us sell to them at 25%. So, like, it's this averaging of what we can get based off of who they are.

831
01:18:37.685 --> 01:18:49.274
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): target… so when you fill out the opportunity, you'll say, okay, this is a $500,000 opportunity, my target GP is 20%. It'll calculate the GP dollars based on the 20%, and based on your.

832
01:18:49.830 --> 01:18:55.099
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Ability percentage. So it should just default to 22% then, and then people can change it if it's different.

833
01:18:56.070 --> 01:19:15.520
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): But, like, right now in Core, everything defaults to whatever we set them as a customer. So, like, we know with Google, it's always 12.5%, but they can also go… so any new thing they create will always be at 12.5%. But if it's something different with Google, we can get more, we get less, we can adjust it, obviously, at the line level.

834
01:19:15.525 --> 01:19:19.265
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): That's kind of an interesting concept. So you have a default GP percentage on the customer.

835
01:19:19.265 --> 01:19:28.664
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): We have a default as a company, and then obviously we can't always get what we want. Yeah. So then at the customer level, we can also set a default.

836
01:19:28.985 --> 01:19:33.015
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Okay, and then the salesperson can override it on the opportunity? Yes.

837
01:19:33.150 --> 01:19:35.169
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Or the PC, or the account manager.

838
01:19:35.175 --> 01:19:46.055
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Okay, so let me just state this from the transcript, because it's a little bit different than what we're doing, but easy to accommodate. So, a global GP percentage, target GP percentage. As a company. As a company, 22%.

839
01:19:46.205 --> 01:19:48.385
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): But then a field on the customer record.

840
01:19:48.585 --> 01:19:59.154
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): To keep track of customer target GP percentage that sources through the opportunity by the opportunity at creation, but the user can… any user can override that. Yeah.

841
01:19:59.160 --> 01:19:59.730
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): Oh, yeah.

842
01:19:59.730 --> 01:20:05.969
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And right now, when they override it, if it's less than what our company goal is, it puts their GP in red.

843
01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:15.570
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): At the order level. At the order level. So when you log into that order, at the very top, it shows you the total GP for that order, and if it's below 22%, it's in red.

844
01:20:16.150 --> 01:20:32.519
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I don't want something like that. Doesn't have to happen, I'm just telling you that's what happens. Okay, yeah, okay. I do want, at the very top level of a header page of a project, to be able to see time entry and, like, a synopsis of what's going on. Time entry, erosion data, GP data.

845
01:20:32.665 --> 01:20:35.755
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Now, all the project KPIs. Yeah. Yeah, we have, like.

846
01:20:36.395 --> 01:20:40.744
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): 12, I think total sales, overcost, GP, cash balance, good balance.

847
01:20:40.745 --> 01:20:44.775
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): group. We're not there yet, but I guess while we're talking about it.

848
01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:51.000
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Sales teams. Do you guys work in sales teams?

849
01:20:51.630 --> 01:20:59.239
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Buying sales teams. Two salespeople that are gonna split commissions, or two or more that are gonna split commissions. Sometimes…

850
01:20:59.800 --> 01:21:13.210
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): It's very rare that they're actually successful on the team, so they might start out as a team, and then we lose, because they went into the team instead of individuals. Okay. And when they do, it's an even split, or when, historically, it has been an even split.

851
01:21:14.780 --> 01:21:23.549
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): The conversation we had earlier about commission types has made that more complicated, so we'll have to have a bigger conversation about how that could even be possible nitrogen.

852
01:21:24.180 --> 01:21:26.369
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Okay, well, we'll come back to that.

853
01:21:27.010 --> 01:21:32.990
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Do you do any other tracking by sales rep, performance metrics, closing ratios?

854
01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:34.239
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Oh, we try…

855
01:21:34.245 --> 01:21:41.514
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): We had to start developing some things, and it hasn't… we haven't been able to refine it, but, like, forecasted versus actual, right? So, if…

856
01:21:41.525 --> 01:21:57.924
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): we have people who are forecasting, we're gonna close all of this, and then what they actually book in that month, we've started to create it. But in order for that to really be useful, I think we need to develop some parameters, and we need to take, like, maybe it's a 3-month average, maybe it's a 5-month average, because of course.

857
01:21:57.955 --> 01:22:04.564
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Things are volatile and moving and changing, but overall, it'd be good to know, like.

858
01:22:04.695 --> 01:22:20.075
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): are you being accurate? So, if we're using that to make business decisions, we kind of need to know that if there's someone who's saying we're going to close things all the time, we're never closing anything, like, that's kind of a red flag. So, yeah, I mean, we kind of have tried to develop that, but

859
01:22:20.075 --> 01:22:26.785
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): the reporting is so manual that it hasn't been very successful. I think that there's an opportunity to track some.

860
01:22:26.785 --> 01:22:27.524
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): Yeah, we're trying to.

861
01:22:27.530 --> 01:22:30.909
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): identify trends, just like she said, like, people who are

862
01:22:31.210 --> 01:22:37.840
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): generally pretty spot on. People who forecast wildly off, and you can address those things.

863
01:22:37.845 --> 01:22:45.734
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Before we even get to that stage, Jillian's doing a ton of data matrix and tracking at the RFP level, like.

864
01:22:45.915 --> 01:22:54.104
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): what are individual salespeople's win rates based off the number of RFPs that they're coming in, who's generating the most RFPs, but has the lowest, like.

865
01:22:54.485 --> 01:23:12.825
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yeah, the person that's generating the most RFPs also has the lowest win rate, so, like, but their volume's one of the highest, so, like, we can see, oh, this person takes 5 times more RFPs than this person to generate the same amount of volume, or a greater amount of volume, but that's all being done by Jillian and her team.

866
01:23:12.825 --> 01:23:16.435
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): putting that into spreadsheets and tracking that data. Yeah.

867
01:23:16.435 --> 01:23:34.534
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): that by sector, as well, so we can say, okay, like, we got to see, like, the tech goes down this much percent, but this other sector's gone this much. Okay, we need to change our approach for how we're going to market, because they're very different, which requires a different skill set of the team, and I should… healthcare and contract work is very different than tech.

868
01:23:34.605 --> 01:23:53.895
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): It's just night and day. And, another part of that, too, is actually time tracking. So, I get another report from a team that we have in the Philippines, and I'm getting their time entry on each project, so over time, I can see… and it takes a while to get the

869
01:23:54.005 --> 01:24:13.264
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): like, to be able to analyze it, but I want to be able to see, okay, we're spending this many hours on each of these stakeholders, and here's the ROI that we're getting from their VIN. What does that look like? Right. So I'm tracking that now. But we're only, like, 6 months in, so… Gotcha.

870
01:24:13.270 --> 01:24:13.980
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): more months.

871
01:24:13.980 --> 01:24:16.329
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): But it'd be,

872
01:24:17.740 --> 01:24:27.590
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): helpful or hindering for us to… we have an entire list of all the reports that we use. We basically started this project last year to talk about

873
01:24:27.590 --> 01:24:40.139
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Okay, here's every report we're creating, who's looking at what, and are they actually still valid? And so we've kind of condensed all of that. We can send that to you, and maybe even tag it of, like, who's looking at it and why.

874
01:24:40.145 --> 01:24:55.144
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): That would be helpful, and then also would be… the next step after that would be, which of these do you actually want in NetSuite now? Yeah. Because there is going to be… like, it would probably make sense to get as much of that in NetSuite eventually. Right. But how much should we plan on for Phase 1?

875
01:24:55.145 --> 01:25:04.255
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Well, what I'm interested in is, of those 400 reports, how much of that already exists, but might look slightly different, and are we okay with the difference? Yeah, right. Yeah. I'd be willing to bet it's…

876
01:25:05.010 --> 01:25:10.939
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): 80% of the reports that we've created are in NetSuite on the tops. Yeah, that'd be nice.

877
01:25:10.940 --> 01:25:18.219
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): So we probably need to do, like, similar mapping that we've done, you know, for each report. So, yeah, who would we work with on that? Would that be good? Or you?

878
01:25:18.225 --> 01:25:24.224
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): I have the name and a snippet of what it looks like, the header type stuff, so…

879
01:25:24.225 --> 01:25:28.585
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I don't know that we have the marketing reports, though, so we should incorporate… No, no, I do not have the marketing reports.

880
01:25:29.970 --> 01:25:31.960
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): So there's more than 400?

881
01:25:31.965 --> 01:25:33.445
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): No, no, no, no, that was…

882
01:25:33.445 --> 01:25:38.854
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): On average, I think, what do we come up with? There's 36 custom reports that we're looking at every month.

883
01:25:38.975 --> 01:25:39.664
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): But that's just.

884
01:25:39.670 --> 01:25:40.480
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): Really?

885
01:25:40.485 --> 01:25:41.015
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): and…

886
01:25:41.020 --> 01:25:41.730
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): Right?

887
01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:47.680
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I would add yours as part of that 36. There's 30 in CORE that we're looking at every month.

888
01:25:48.460 --> 01:25:51.900
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): But I know every… the first day of every month, I send out

889
01:25:52.220 --> 01:25:55.099
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): 6 or 8, 6… Yeah, you do. Yeah.

890
01:25:55.790 --> 01:26:00.759
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Then we have what Kevin and team are grading, and then we have what Mark is creating.

891
01:26:00.765 --> 01:26:01.794
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): And then we also.

892
01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:12.070
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): to have. Yeah, anyways, we'll clean it up, it's a to-do list. Okay, we have 3 minutes. Anything else before… oh, wait, this is the same group. Yeah.

893
01:26:12.075 --> 01:26:12.794
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): trying to… I'm.

894
01:26:12.795 --> 01:26:16.685
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Kind of just going through my list and picking up some yet talked about,

895
01:26:17.785 --> 01:26:24.554
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): For those reports, just stick them in the, setup that you config across this area, because they kind of span across all…

896
01:26:25.165 --> 01:26:28.565
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Any particular KPIs that you guys are tracking for sales?

897
01:26:28.725 --> 01:26:30.055
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): For sales?

898
01:26:32.750 --> 01:26:39.769
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And we're looking at… Volume, of course. We're looking at erosion.

899
01:26:39.775 --> 01:26:44.764
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Define erosion for me. Well, how do you define it? I know what it is, but I can define it.

900
01:26:44.765 --> 01:26:48.065
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): laughing because Kip's in the room.

901
01:26:49.270 --> 01:27:01.829
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Kip has a much more strict definition than we do. Erosion, the way that it is calculated, is any impact to the GP cost only, after the order has been flipped.

902
01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:08.250
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): But we… Adjust that based off of…

903
01:27:08.780 --> 01:27:18.990
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I guess, what would we call it, Kimmy? Well, I guess you'd call it a winner, I'd call it mad money. Sometimes we inflate shipping lines, or freight lines, building in some safety nets.

904
01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:22.590
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And so, if that is built in, then I don't have that as erosion.

905
01:27:23.340 --> 01:27:36.700
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Kip, with very good, valid points, does count that as erosion, because if we didn't catch that mad money, it would technically be ours. So yeah, it's basically anything that impacts the GP after the order is replaced.

906
01:27:36.705 --> 01:27:50.525
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): Once it gets flipped from a quote to an open order, the margin is affected in a negative. I mean, I guess you can have an erosion… erosion is inherently negative, so anything that affects… makes the margin reduced. Yeah.

907
01:27:50.530 --> 01:27:53.719
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): So ours is a little bit different. Okay. We do margin delta.

908
01:27:54.170 --> 01:28:00.080
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): So, it's… the budget's locked at booking, so if you add lines, whether it's sell or cost.

909
01:28:00.085 --> 01:28:06.404
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Well, I should say margin can be increased or eroded. It goes both ways. It's a variance. It's a variance.

910
01:28:06.405 --> 01:28:07.015
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): of the attribute.

911
01:28:07.015 --> 01:28:07.955
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): Yeah.

912
01:28:07.960 --> 01:28:08.490
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): Yeah.

913
01:28:08.710 --> 01:28:09.850
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): And then.

914
01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:16.579
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Well, we don't ever go, like, oh, look at how much we picked up on margin. We're always like, what did you do? Unfortunate.

915
01:28:16.585 --> 01:28:20.195
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Definitely. We should… we should do that. Well, we're working on it.

916
01:28:21.110 --> 01:28:25.329
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Finish your… and then there's something I have to add to that. Is the budget versus actual report of the project.

917
01:28:25.335 --> 01:28:27.845
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): record. Okay, great. So as the actuals come in.

918
01:28:27.875 --> 01:28:46.725
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): And cost is… revenue and cost actuals come in, and the report is updated, and then eventually you'll have a complete… you actually do have… you always have a complete budget versus an actual report. It just gets clearer as the actuals come into real life. So it's like a projected… it's a blend, it's a projected, blended actual…

919
01:28:47.045 --> 01:28:49.595
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): They'll certainly actualize, and there's a percent…

920
01:28:49.595 --> 01:28:51.245
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): is, what, acknowledged?

921
01:28:51.545 --> 01:28:55.954
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): No, it's not acknowledged. Actually, it is when it actually is hitting the GL.

922
01:28:56.215 --> 01:29:01.955
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): When there's a… so, if it's invoiced, that's an actualization, and if it's…

923
01:29:02.125 --> 01:29:10.224
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): In NetSuite, if the item is fulfilled, that's an actualization on the cost side. Okay. And then if it's a dropship, it would be on the vendor bill side.

924
01:29:10.230 --> 01:29:12.430
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): and accounting, yeah. Finance one, good.

925
01:29:12.435 --> 01:29:18.745
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): Financially, and you're defining budget a little differently than we are, because we would say budgeting is pre-quote phase.

926
01:29:18.785 --> 01:29:33.045
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): And then actual is once it's turned from a quote to an open order. That's actual. We don't wait till it's billed or invoiced to call it actual, it's when it is booked. That's actual to us. Oh, I thought budget was when it was booked.

927
01:29:34.265 --> 01:29:37.985
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): No, budget, I mean, and this is going to walk under the furniture.

928
01:29:37.990 --> 01:29:52.899
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): We do a budget for the customer well before we ever get a quote to make sure that we're… so we're doing a rough order of magnitude to say, like, do you want to spend $10,000 on a sofa, or do you want us to go look for $3,000 sofas? Yeah.

929
01:29:53.260 --> 01:29:54.150
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Okay.

930
01:29:54.320 --> 01:29:58.450
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I think it's just a language thing, but we can work around that.

931
01:29:58.455 --> 01:30:08.195
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): The complexity, though, of the two bills, the two invoices that we send, so we send our deposit invoice, and then we send our final invoice, yeah?

932
01:30:08.195 --> 01:30:12.275
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): But just, again, it would take that amount at that time. Yeah.

933
01:30:12.885 --> 01:30:13.365
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): We're…

934
01:30:13.370 --> 01:30:16.670
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): Half of complexity of margin is a soft cost.

935
01:30:17.340 --> 01:30:19.990
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): That sometimes we're including

936
01:30:20.440 --> 01:30:26.210
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): designer and PMO, or sometimes we're not. And obviously then when I get to the financials, you know.

937
01:30:26.210 --> 01:30:31.769
Speaker 10 (Cornerstone): So, I do have a point in time and different margins that we're looking at, and we're trying to

938
01:30:32.040 --> 01:30:35.380
Speaker 10 (Cornerstone): correlate all of them to explain, like, things you want to talk about.

939
01:30:35.380 --> 01:30:36.080
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): brought that down.

940
01:30:36.085 --> 01:30:37.585
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And that finance management.

941
01:30:37.585 --> 01:30:43.615
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Okay. And we'll go deep on it, and then, yeah, because there's some decisions you have to make about what you want to include in that. Perfect.

942
01:30:43.620 --> 01:30:49.960
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yep. So, the one thing on the variances, or erosion, or whatever you want to call it.

943
01:30:52.600 --> 01:30:53.610
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): his…

944
01:30:53.860 --> 01:30:59.960
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): They code them based off of what type of content, so, like, people don't need to put a cost in the assassinate.

945
01:30:59.965 --> 01:31:00.564
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): That's settlement.

946
01:31:00.570 --> 01:31:03.440
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): What we try to do, though, is that the…

947
01:31:05.510 --> 01:31:09.339
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Somebody forgets to put freight in, so that's a $1,000 amenity.

948
01:31:09.770 --> 01:31:25.790
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): client adds on another order, they add on, so there's a date order, you can pick up that $1,000 again. The code is the same, so they cancel each other out. Maybe on the reporting side of it, right? Because if we're pulling volume by variance code.

949
01:31:25.830 --> 01:31:45.660
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): if there's a negative and a positive, they're going to combine and then create a new total. So we would want to continue that, because, okay, yeah, we could have a lot of hits, but we could also have a lot of pickups, and we try to get the PCs to code them the same, the pickups the same as the hits, so that they become less of a financial impact, and we can track that gain. So we're just…

950
01:31:45.665 --> 01:31:48.834
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): Tagging the variances, and we'd want those tags.

951
01:31:48.955 --> 01:31:58.425
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): as long as the person who's entering it uses the same tag on both, and it's the same person on both, in theory, when they're going to report in there and neutralize one another.

952
01:31:58.425 --> 01:32:03.585
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): I think I need a better understanding of this whole concept of… it's almost like an early budget.

953
01:32:03.685 --> 01:32:04.755
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Preliminary budget?

954
01:32:04.760 --> 01:32:05.780
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): after the fact.

955
01:32:06.040 --> 01:32:08.550
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So I flipped the order. When you say flip the.

956
01:32:08.550 --> 01:32:10.490
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): January, are you talking about you book it?

957
01:32:10.490 --> 01:32:18.470
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): We booked the order, and then after we booked the order, we get an acknowledgement back from one of our vendor partners, and we didn't put

958
01:32:18.560 --> 01:32:40.240
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): we'd have to put rate, or tariffs as a line. So, now the acknowledgement has come back greater than what we sold it for. So, we have to add a line for that new amount, and it goes in as a negative, because there's no cell associated with it, because we can't go back to the client, or they don't want to go back to the client.

959
01:32:40.240 --> 01:32:49.380
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And they… the number one… the number one thing I'm always told is, Matt, please approve, I'm going to resell this on the next order, they have another order coming. And I say.

960
01:32:49.380 --> 01:32:51.570
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Great.

961
01:32:51.660 --> 01:32:56.370
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Make sure you code the cell the same variants so that they wash each other out.

962
01:32:56.820 --> 01:33:13.760
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So, we have codes that go with that variance. If you put in a negative, there's a variance code of why you're putting in a negative, so that we can run reports off of that. So, is it a design error? Is it a customer accommodation? Vendor issue? Shipping, yeah.

963
01:33:14.250 --> 01:33:18.929
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So that we're able to, like, isolate what those issues are into buckets.

964
01:33:22.230 --> 01:33:23.490
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): Okay.

965
01:33:23.960 --> 01:33:29.819
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I mean, maybe if you say that it's not possible, we'll have an entire cultural shift, I think the entire…

966
01:33:30.620 --> 01:33:37.190
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): No, it's always possible, I just want to just interrupt my mind around. So, at the time you enter the line, you identify the code.

967
01:33:38.100 --> 01:33:42.379
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): At that time, it's known. It wasn't known until that one. Yeah.

968
01:33:42.380 --> 01:33:47.559
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Yeah, yeah. And it's kind of, it's kind of the reason why, right?

969
01:33:47.565 --> 01:33:57.954
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): That's the reason why. We used to make it a department issue, because they used to be, way back when, they would be bonused off of if they hit variance goals, lack of variance goals, basically.

970
01:33:58.135 --> 01:34:16.825
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And then that got too much of, like, well, the PCs control what the code is, so if it's a PC error, they could technically just make it a design error. So then I was playing that whole game. So then we just were like, okay, let's just focus on what the issue is versus whose problem it is, what the problem is. And so that's where we are today. And where's the report?

971
01:34:16.825 --> 01:34:21.345
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): who are, you know, where's the report? Where does that live on the variances? It's interesting.

972
01:34:25.270 --> 01:34:34.080
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): complication to it, if we have a threshold, too, and if it exceeds, what is it, $1,500? Yeah, we try to go through the executives for approval, so I don't know if that's…

973
01:34:34.085 --> 01:34:36.325
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): I don't need another approval.

974
01:34:36.325 --> 01:34:41.565
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): Well, we don't really have a way of stopping people from doing that, it's just kind of beyond our system and getting us the internet out of it, like.

975
01:34:41.565 --> 01:34:44.555
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Well, in the new system, we wouldn't have a way to stop this.

976
01:34:44.970 --> 01:34:52.119
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): So to answer your question, I think I know what you're asking. No, I haven't run into this with any other dealers, they're tracking the variances this way. Do they track at all?

977
01:34:53.160 --> 01:35:03.710
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): They track margin erosion, and then what they want is reported at the end of why the margin eroded. How do they get that report? They… they can dig through it through the audit trail.

978
01:35:03.890 --> 01:35:05.630
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): So, it just takes a minute.

979
01:35:06.670 --> 01:35:16.780
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): when a line changed. So, like, if we had a design error, let's say, and we had to order, you know, 75 new fronts or something, you would have to just go and look at the lines. It wouldn't…

980
01:35:17.380 --> 01:35:20.540
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): I like what you guys are doing, though. I just… I was just trying to…

981
01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:32.760
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): I think all I need is the list of the reasons why, the codes, and… It goes on as a line note, basically. Yeah, we'll have it as a drop-down, you just select it. And at that point, do you even need a code? Can we just say what it is? I mean, that's basically what the.

982
01:35:32.765 --> 01:35:33.845
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): code ends, it's code is.

983
01:35:33.850 --> 01:35:36.699
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): It's not like a two-digit. Oh, okay. I don't think so.

984
01:35:36.900 --> 01:35:41.320
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): Maybe this is a good opportunity for us to review and revisit those codes.

985
01:35:41.325 --> 01:35:41.915
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): I have an opinion.

986
01:35:41.920 --> 01:35:47.289
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): about it, Katie. Do you not think we should have the variance codes? What… oh, no.

987
01:35:47.295 --> 01:35:51.545
Speaker 11 (Cornerstone): I do. I was just gonna look up the list, send it, but,

988
01:35:52.595 --> 01:35:59.425
Speaker 11 (Cornerstone): I've got my salesperson, Hannah, or, like, Owen. Is it right? Okay. Like, tongue of the town.

989
01:35:59.430 --> 01:36:00.350
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): Thank goodness.

990
01:36:00.720 --> 01:36:06.860
Speaker 11 (Cornerstone): sometimes he'll just be like, oh, we need to get this proposal out the door, like, I have to do this this week.

991
01:36:06.920 --> 01:36:21.020
Speaker 11 (Cornerstone): legitimately guessed at, like, all the lines. That should be a code. And so then, like, but I upped the GP, right? So that's kind of what Matt was saying. I just don't… that feels so gray, like, I don't know how you put that in a report. Rushing.

992
01:36:21.140 --> 01:36:21.760
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Well, and…

993
01:36:21.765 --> 01:36:27.774
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): It's one of those reports where it's kind of like… It's hard to scramble. I look at it with a grain of salt.

994
01:36:27.925 --> 01:36:28.765
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Okay.

995
01:36:29.185 --> 01:36:42.064
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): People send it to me and be like, oh my god, look at this number, and then I'll go back and be like, okay, yep, I looked at it, and while I guess the number looks bad, I know the backstory behind 19 of these things, and we're gonna pick it up here. So, it's more…

996
01:36:42.355 --> 01:36:47.044
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): You can't manage off that report. Like, direct manage off that report.

997
01:36:47.045 --> 01:36:56.804
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): We looked at it last year, at the end of the year, and we said, okay, most of our erosion was due to customer accommodation. Yeah, everybody thought it was going.

998
01:36:56.805 --> 01:36:59.824
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): to be design errors, it's actually customer accommodations. Right.

999
01:36:59.825 --> 01:37:09.565
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): That's what anyone would say if they didn't want to cover their tracks. You're gonna say, oh, that's disgusting. I mean, you know? That's a problem with… inherently, it just results in a lot of finger-pointing. It's just…

1000
01:37:09.565 --> 01:37:12.045
Speaker 10 (Cornerstone): to the point that Kimmy's making.

1001
01:37:12.205 --> 01:37:17.825
Speaker 10 (Cornerstone): did that get tagged as customer combination? Because that… that's kind of blaming the customer for something a customer…

1002
01:37:17.825 --> 01:37:18.585
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): exclaiming Owen.

1003
01:37:18.585 --> 01:37:20.064
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): No, no, but…

1004
01:37:20.065 --> 01:37:28.325
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Customer accommodation means the salesperson decided that the best thing to do was to accommodate the customer to keep the relationship going.

1005
01:37:28.325 --> 01:37:37.304
Speaker 10 (Cornerstone): As opposed to a customer saying, oh, change my mind, didn't like this, didn't want this, or I know I ordered this, but now I want that, like, that's a true customer decision, like…

1006
01:37:37.305 --> 01:37:55.635
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): We've had customers say, well, this isn't what I thought I was getting, and we're like, well, okay, we're gonna replace it, and we mark it as a customer combination. Again, it's really just, like, a conversation starter. It has to track metrics around, like, what are people mentally doing when they're spending company money on projects?

1007
01:37:55.960 --> 01:38:06.530
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): How about we do this? Let's take a break real quick, because we didn't take a break. We need to stretch back and a bathroom break. And then, I think, just for the sake of the transcript, the requirement here, though, is to track

1008
01:38:06.910 --> 01:38:11.320
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Are these… are these going to be cost-only lines that are added, or are there any…

1009
01:38:11.325 --> 01:38:24.145
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): There can be a sell sometimes, too, and the sell offsets the cost. That's what I was saying. Like, it needs to be able to flow both ways. Yeah. Because if they do resell it, they might resell it on another project as a sell-only line, with the same code. Okay.

1010
01:38:24.145 --> 01:38:25.124
Speaker 10 (Cornerstone): I'm sure it could give us a crack.

1011
01:38:25.125 --> 01:38:25.564
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): it, too.

1012
01:38:25.865 --> 01:38:26.675
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Like, for something.

1013
01:38:26.680 --> 01:38:36.279
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yeah, sometimes we put in a cost only, and we're waiting for a credit to come back from no customer service, because we put in a claim… claims work. Yeah.

1014
01:38:36.280 --> 01:38:49.630
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): The requirement here is, though, is to track variances. Yep. Yep. And so, we have variance code that we could implement. We also have issues and issue types that we could use in track lists as well, but I do kind of like the way you guys are doing this a little bit simplified.

1015
01:38:49.700 --> 01:38:59.319
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): So… but if… the thing with the issues is I could create an issue with that same code, and I could assign it to somebody, or it could need to get approved. So there's, like, a little bit more management.

1016
01:38:59.325 --> 01:39:03.455
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): We could call it an issue if that's the way we want to do it, versus a $1,500 limit.

1017
01:39:04.090 --> 01:39:11.180
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): we were talking about earlier. Issues in our system are… it's a pretty general thing, it's a range of things. It could be a punch issue.

1018
01:39:11.185 --> 01:39:13.445
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I was gonna say their issues the same as punch. Yeah.

1019
01:39:13.445 --> 01:39:18.245
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Punch, acknowledgement discrepancy, vendor price discrepancy.

1020
01:39:18.245 --> 01:39:19.545
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Obviously, the issue is just…

1021
01:39:19.975 --> 01:39:29.264
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): pausing the process and assigning a role to someone, and then if you choose to do so, and then until there's a decision made, it's frozen, and then it, once it's made it.

1022
01:39:29.265 --> 01:39:30.195
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): Subscription.

1023
01:39:30.200 --> 01:39:35.279
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Yeah, you can… you can freeze it, you don't have to, but the idea is there's something that needs to be resolved. Yeah.

1024
01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:38.940
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yeah, I'm fine with issue as well, whatever you think would be best. Okay.

1025
01:39:38.945 --> 01:39:41.884
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): For now, we're just lacking that requirement we need to check earlier, yes.

1026
01:39:43.285 --> 01:39:45.454
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): So we can take a… take a break.

1027
01:39:45.460 --> 01:39:51.310
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Are we… what are we doing next? Are we staying on this, or are we going somewhere else?

1028
01:39:51.520 --> 01:39:58.389
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Do you want to know if I can cut, Carlos and Alex and Kate and Jillian. Yeah, we could.

1029
01:39:58.395 --> 01:40:02.475
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): There's probably just a couple more things to finish up. Okay, let's stretch our legs and then come back.

1030
01:40:09.610 --> 01:40:11.040
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): Swing me over for a sec.

1031
01:40:13.040 --> 01:40:15.590
Cornerstone: I can expose myself for your daughter.

1032
01:40:17.740 --> 01:40:20.909
Speaker 10 (Cornerstone): Are you okay? Yeah.

1033
01:40:21.330 --> 01:40:22.129
Alex Blangeres: Hey, Matt!

1034
01:40:23.710 --> 01:40:28.020
Alex Blangeres: You're gonna keep this… this one going and not log into the next one, correct?

1035
01:40:28.500 --> 01:40:32.250
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): The next one is, what, just us again?

1036
01:40:32.255 --> 01:40:34.225
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): It's the CRM, Linda thing.

1037
01:40:34.225 --> 01:40:37.865
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Which we've basically been doing. So yeah, I'll just leave it here, we'll put it all into one.

1038
01:40:37.870 --> 01:40:38.540
Alex Blangeres: Okay.

1039
01:40:40.350 --> 01:40:41.570
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Hey, coffee.

1040
01:40:44.540 --> 01:40:49.989
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): It's almost there, it's almost 4 o'clock. The time difference begins to kick in in the afternoon.

1041
01:40:57.060 --> 01:41:03.130
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Okay, experiences… I always know when you pulled that report, because…

1042
01:41:03.770 --> 01:41:10.420
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Like, the most Zoom… the most Zoom chats from you about, can you believe it?

1043
01:41:10.425 --> 01:41:15.135
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): I don't know, like, I was thinking about you the other day, because, like, in the last couple weeks, I've seen some…

1044
01:41:15.445 --> 01:41:26.094
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): really, really, really ugly variance isn't about baby. Yeah. Lose it. I was like, I think about how I feel. I'm like, I can't imagine how that feels with this. Well, that baby.

1045
01:41:26.095 --> 01:41:28.425
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): one for Sequoia.

1046
01:41:28.425 --> 01:41:35.165
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): They were solely for chairs.

1047
01:41:35.345 --> 01:41:35.925
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): for…

1048
01:41:35.925 --> 01:41:37.035
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): Warwick. Oh, that was.

1049
01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:38.159
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): sort of, and…

1050
01:41:38.165 --> 01:41:39.685
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): It was, the…

1051
01:41:39.685 --> 01:41:43.975
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): maybe bought… found a buyer for them. Thank God. Yeah.

1052
01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:47.259
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): I gotta buy them for at least what we paid? For the new one.

1053
01:41:47.505 --> 01:41:56.885
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Oh, good. Yeah. So, for your break-even. Good. And then, for the table tops, or Sequoia, I found an E&O claim, I don't know if we can get it, but…

1054
01:41:57.325 --> 01:42:01.904
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): It was an error, so hoping that they'll pay it out soon, so…

1055
01:42:01.910 --> 01:42:04.970
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): Yeah, there he is. Yeah, we haven't had that hard of.

1056
01:42:04.970 --> 01:42:06.220
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I had a long time.

1057
01:42:06.225 --> 01:42:12.224
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): It's painful. I'm glad you… I figured that might happen with those chairs, and I'm like, well, you can probably re-spell or maybe.

1058
01:42:12.225 --> 01:42:19.075
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And then SMU, the whole SMU project for the case phase is at a negative 22%.

1059
01:42:19.075 --> 01:42:19.725
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Is it negatively.

1060
01:42:19.730 --> 01:42:22.540
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): A casefin.

1061
01:42:22.540 --> 01:42:23.240
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): Fair.

1062
01:42:23.860 --> 01:42:24.220
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): It's huge.

1063
01:42:24.225 --> 01:42:33.224
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): respond… I was gonna ask you, did you respond to Maria Cora? Like, when you… that… I could not believe how she responded. She… when you said, is there a bug? She's like.

1064
01:42:33.225 --> 01:42:42.224
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): There's no funding. Like, how can you create this? Well, she still hasn't responded to, like, what I'm supposed to do. I need to run his commissions today. And that's what I kept.

1065
01:42:42.225 --> 01:43:00.224
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): tell her, like, we're trying to get this up this week. But her response is, like, I was flabbergasted, like, you provide this tool for us to run it based on project, and then you tell us, don't run it on project. Like, well, then don't provide that tool for us. Right. And then when we use it and say, it's not working, is there a bug? No, it's not.

1066
01:43:00.225 --> 01:43:04.495
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): There's no bug. Well, it's funny to find out that they only run off of projects.

1067
01:43:04.975 --> 01:43:11.204
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): No other… well, they told… what was her name? What's her name? The… breathe? No, the…

1068
01:43:11.335 --> 01:43:23.914
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Joanne. Joanne. Matt, no one else is using this. I'm like, okay, well, Joanne, don't keep doing… I… I… this is how the commission plan is built, and you offer this setup, and it's been like this from the beginning of time. I need to use that. Yeah.

1069
01:43:24.720 --> 01:43:29.730
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): So, I mean, how long has that been going on? It's only for project-based, though, right? So it only.

1070
01:43:29.735 --> 01:43:32.154
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Only for a project, it only affects him.

1071
01:43:32.160 --> 01:43:36.059
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): But how long has it been going on? He's had that since January of last year.

1072
01:43:37.190 --> 01:43:40.929
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So I'm hoping there's nothing big, but if there is, I'm gonna start…

1073
01:43:41.450 --> 01:43:52.010
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Well, that one that we just talked about… Well, that one he knows about, but I haven't paid him yet, so he knows it's coming, that's why I've been waiting. But I'm hoping if there's smaller stuff, I can just kind of…

1074
01:43:53.070 --> 01:43:56.560
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): Over time. Or sold it out over the next 2 years.

1075
01:43:56.565 --> 01:43:59.634
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I mean, we've already lost it at this point.

1076
01:43:59.640 --> 01:44:01.860
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): Death by a thousand paper cuts. Yeah.

1077
01:44:04.580 --> 01:44:05.840
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): Clever, clever.

1078
01:45:49.680 --> 01:45:50.980
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): Same like this class.

1079
01:46:29.750 --> 01:46:31.839
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): I mean, again, we don't have those things.

1080
01:46:32.200 --> 01:46:33.160
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): It's fun.

1081
01:46:52.250 --> 01:46:54.489
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): Not a million questions.

1082
01:46:54.495 --> 01:46:59.055
Speaker 10 (Cornerstone): Thank you, Mother. Thank you.

1083
01:47:14.140 --> 01:47:19.130
Speaker 10 (Cornerstone): I liked the lunch that came today, that was really good. Oh, really?

1084
01:47:19.130 --> 01:47:23.099
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): What's yours again? Afaro Solid. Oh, yeah, that one was a good choice.

1085
01:47:23.105 --> 01:47:24.685
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): It was really yummy.

1086
01:47:24.810 --> 01:47:26.820
Speaker 10 (Cornerstone): That's correct. Yeah, me and my.

1087
01:47:26.825 --> 01:47:29.144
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): This is for Thursday.

1088
01:47:29.145 --> 01:47:34.585
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): I'm gonna add… Kim? And Kim? And Kim.

1089
01:47:34.590 --> 01:47:35.639
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): What do you mean?

1090
01:47:35.645 --> 01:47:38.255
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): I need to borrow somebody's spend.

1091
01:47:38.255 --> 01:47:39.165
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): I have a pencil right there.

1092
01:47:39.165 --> 01:47:39.755
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Thank you so much.

1093
01:47:39.760 --> 01:47:42.569
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): Shh, I have everything.

1094
01:47:43.760 --> 01:47:46.930
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): Alex is doing one of the painting.

1095
01:47:56.440 --> 01:47:57.860
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): I love that.

1096
01:47:58.080 --> 01:48:03.189
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): Okay, I'll see how long it.

1097
01:48:03.460 --> 01:48:04.950
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): It's much better.

1098
01:48:40.780 --> 01:48:42.120
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): Yeah, I like to…

1099
01:49:05.210 --> 01:49:06.370
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): Kind of pulling those…

1100
01:49:33.170 --> 01:49:36.799
Speaker 10 (Cornerstone): Yeah, I have to go back to the grade of 1906.

1101
01:49:36.800 --> 01:49:37.449
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): What we got?

1102
01:49:42.370 --> 01:49:43.640
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): Curricular control.

1103
01:49:46.440 --> 01:49:49.860
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): Thank you.

1104
01:49:50.430 --> 01:50:00.929
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): This, Ravina, the ones I have up here on, I have two right here. I have done them so hard, I have these big bruises. I'm gonna get you cortisone, too, then, because I don't hold up any later.

1105
01:50:04.360 --> 01:50:05.460
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Yeah, that's new.

1106
01:50:06.240 --> 01:50:10.799
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Well, I'm still trying to get caught up, because I just got vaccinated. Oh, yeah!

1107
01:50:10.805 --> 01:50:13.015
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): How was your trip? It was good.

1108
01:50:13.145 --> 01:50:17.345
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Your brother got married, right? Sister. Oh, your sister, okay. How was the wedding?

1109
01:50:17.405 --> 01:50:25.624
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): It was extravagant. I love that. It was very… it was at a 12th century castle in southern Italy, and it was extravagant.

1110
01:50:25.625 --> 01:50:27.965
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Amazing. Oh, she's correct.

1111
01:50:28.400 --> 01:50:28.760
Speaker 10 (Cornerstone): My…

1112
01:50:28.765 --> 01:50:29.774
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): I guess, yeah.

1113
01:50:30.070 --> 01:50:31.180
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): I dress this one.

1114
01:50:31.180 --> 01:50:31.819
Speaker 11 (Cornerstone): You were, like, in the.

1115
01:50:31.825 --> 01:50:32.715
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): bridal party.

1116
01:50:32.715 --> 01:50:34.175
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): She didn't have a break, okay.

1117
01:50:34.445 --> 01:50:40.134
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): She presided. How vague was the wedding? There was 120 guests, and it was, like.

1118
01:50:40.950 --> 01:50:46.619
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): I mean, it was like, we started out on the terrace, but I can't. I just looked at following myself.

1119
01:50:46.940 --> 01:50:50.679
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Once I start, and it's really bad.

1120
01:50:51.150 --> 01:50:55.230
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): I can't even remember what album. I have shared albums, I have…

1121
01:50:55.820 --> 01:50:57.230
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): What part of Italy?

1122
01:50:58.310 --> 01:51:03.985
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): It was in Salento, like Campania, above Santa Maria, south of the Nope. Shit.

1123
01:51:04.400 --> 01:51:05.030
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): I'm sorry.

1124
01:51:05.035 --> 01:51:09.385
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): They had, like, oh, well, that would have been very.

1125
01:51:09.385 --> 01:51:21.285
Speaker 10 (Cornerstone): A full… On the ice. Okay. As I've been sitting here all day today, I've had about 3 or 4 of those moments as I've seen people. I've never really been that cognizant of what… You're lying there.

1126
01:51:21.285 --> 01:51:26.545
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): That was their ceremony. I'm gonna see this, too.

1127
01:51:26.545 --> 01:51:29.354
Speaker 10 (Cornerstone): Wow. Wow, that's gorgeous.

1128
01:51:30.310 --> 01:51:35.909
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Here's the castle. This was my shower, right there in the terrace.

1129
01:51:35.910 --> 01:51:36.560
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): She does state.

1130
01:51:36.560 --> 01:51:43.840
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Yeah. They had these flag dancers and trumpets and, like, a full thing.

1131
01:51:45.115 --> 01:51:46.235
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Yeah, let's see if it's…

1132
01:51:46.235 --> 01:51:47.285
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): Beautiful.

1133
01:51:47.290 --> 01:51:55.050
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): ceremony location. Allie had, like, 4 different dresses, because it was…

1134
01:51:56.060 --> 01:52:13.989
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): So yeah, they had, like, welcome cocktails, they had, the ceremony, then there was a cocktail hour, which is where they did the flag throwing and stuff. And then, like, dinner? And then they had a show cooking hour, where it was, like, buffalo mozzarella, and, like, they were doing it, like, actively outdoors. Then there was a full…

1135
01:52:13.990 --> 01:52:25.719
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): three-course sit-down dinner. Then there was a reception with a band, and desserts, and cake cutting, and then there was an after-party in the wine case with the DJ.

1136
01:52:25.925 --> 01:52:30.084
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): My sister's wedding. She went to Italy for her sister's wedding.

1137
01:52:30.090 --> 01:52:38.059
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): pretty wild. I didn't do a good job with pictures. I really didn't, because on the day of the wedding, I have to get them the people, because I was…

1138
01:52:38.060 --> 01:52:38.689
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): just sort of say.

1139
01:52:39.120 --> 01:52:46.579
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Yeah, she's been peopled today, because Vanessa posted pictures of them together. Wow.

1140
01:52:48.760 --> 01:52:52.730
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Is she, older or younger than you? My younger sister.

1141
01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.709
Speaker 10 (Cornerstone): Oh, that's so funny. Were you there for…

1142
01:52:56.715 --> 01:53:04.885
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): I was there for two weeks. So the first week we went and did, like, Rome, Naples, I went to all of those cities.

1143
01:53:06.380 --> 01:53:13.849
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): Did you get used to, like, eating dinner at 9pm? We were there with, like…

1144
01:53:13.855 --> 01:53:26.575
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): The hardest is at all of these events, like, because Frank owns… so we went to his farm. He has a 33-acre farm in… Like an olive. Yeah, well, no, it's his grandpa's land. There's grapes, olives, figs.

1145
01:53:26.865 --> 01:53:29.514
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): It's like a opening.

1146
01:53:30.145 --> 01:53:41.505
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): But, so his aunts live there on the farm, and then they own this building where they have a restaurant, which is where the welcome lunch was. It's like we're all sitting there, they bring out this huge plate of food with, like.

1147
01:53:41.745 --> 01:53:45.664
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): mussels and octopus, I mean, it's a ton of seafood, like…

1148
01:53:46.335 --> 01:54:03.825
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): And it's like this, right? So, everyone's, like, eating, everyone's like, oh my god, I'm so bold. Then Allie's like, there's 4 more courses. Oh my god. This is lunch. Like, then there was, like, a clam risotto, then there was a fried fish thing, then there was, like… I mean, it was… it's like…

1149
01:54:03.825 --> 01:54:07.415
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Holy shit, they're feeding you more?

1150
01:54:07.415 --> 01:54:07.925
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): Yeah, exactly.

1151
01:54:07.930 --> 01:54:11.680
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): I do. But it was just, like… Too much. Yeah.

1152
01:54:11.685 --> 01:54:13.185
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): more?

1153
01:54:13.185 --> 01:54:14.245
Speaker 10 (Cornerstone): And more.

1154
01:54:14.245 --> 01:54:23.225
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): and more. And that's what it felt like, kind of at the wedding, too, because the whole show food hour was crazy. And then it was a three-fourths sit-down.

1155
01:54:23.230 --> 01:54:24.200
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): Same food is not like.

1156
01:54:24.205 --> 01:54:28.605
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): Not a whole lot of salads, it's heavy stuff.

1157
01:54:33.765 --> 01:54:37.565
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): Yeah, I remember when we went, and little kids at the time.

1158
01:54:38.025 --> 01:54:46.925
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): Like, we were just shocked, because we were out at, like, 9 o'clock at night, it was a weeknight, and then it might have been later, it might have been 10.

1159
01:54:46.925 --> 01:54:47.665
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): They're rushing.

1160
01:54:47.670 --> 01:54:50.660
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Don't even reopen. No, when I was in Greece last time.

1161
01:54:50.665 --> 01:54:58.924
Speaker 10 (Cornerstone): here, like, at 11 o'clock, people were heading out as I was, like, heading towards the hotel to go to sleep, you know, and they were going out to them.

1162
01:54:58.925 --> 01:55:01.924
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): 2-3 hours in the middle of the day, they go to sleep, and they…

1163
01:55:01.925 --> 01:55:04.164
Speaker 10 (Cornerstone): Yeah, it's a totally different lifestyle.

1164
01:55:04.165 --> 01:55:12.004
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): My son's studying abroad in Spain right now, and I asked him, like, are you used to it? Yeah, he's like, I'm a night person anyway, so it's working for me. Yeah.

1165
01:55:13.235 --> 01:55:19.924
Speaker 10 (Cornerstone): You know, they don't… although they're big a lot, but they don't miss the quantity, like, that we're used to, so they…

1166
01:55:19.925 --> 01:55:22.704
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): I'll tell you what, it was a lot.

1167
01:55:23.540 --> 01:55:24.460
Speaker 11 (Cornerstone): A lot.

1168
01:55:25.930 --> 01:55:32.180
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Yeah, see, this was the reception hall. It was… they were all in different parts of the castle. It was, like, this wild thing.

1169
01:55:32.640 --> 01:55:33.499
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): And that's what you stay.

1170
01:55:34.130 --> 01:55:34.640
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): Yes.

1171
01:55:35.420 --> 01:55:36.900
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): You stayed in a castle there?

1172
01:55:36.905 --> 01:55:39.124
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So, I'm a death in there.

1173
01:55:39.905 --> 01:55:48.474
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): I read, and I'm like, that can't be right, but I read recently, Germany has more castles than America has McDonald's. Wow. Really?

1174
01:55:48.620 --> 01:55:52.640
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): How is that possible? I mean, that's why they were all executed in a basement.

1175
01:55:54.040 --> 01:55:57.990
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): It's dark?

1176
01:56:00.910 --> 01:56:04.360
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): No, it wasn't Germany that was basement, that was Russian… Russian monarch.

1177
01:56:04.365 --> 01:56:07.294
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): Yeah, yeah, I got a couple things.

1178
01:56:09.450 --> 01:56:13.130
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Yeah, I think Nash was a little bit too young.

1179
01:56:13.620 --> 01:56:18.199
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): For, like, the Vatican, and for, like, we went to the Vatican Museum.

1180
01:56:18.205 --> 01:56:18.855
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): is in the past.

1181
01:56:18.860 --> 01:56:19.800
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): again, evidently.

1182
01:56:19.990 --> 01:56:21.309
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Stuff on our diesel.

1183
01:56:21.315 --> 01:56:24.024
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Oh, he's… I don't know where he's laughing.

1184
01:56:24.025 --> 01:56:27.025
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): I just appreciate it on a different level.

1185
01:56:27.025 --> 01:56:28.115
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): much.

1186
01:56:28.120 --> 01:56:30.740
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Walking, and…

1187
01:56:30.745 --> 01:56:37.085
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): The carrot is the gelato every couple hours. Yeah, yeah. Fly Mount Town, and we'll go get some gelato.

1188
01:56:38.570 --> 01:56:40.549
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): Work on me.

1189
01:56:40.550 --> 01:56:42.800
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Definitely on tap.

1190
01:56:42.805 --> 01:56:43.915
Speaker 10 (Cornerstone): letting us.

1191
01:56:45.420 --> 01:56:49.159
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Jack would just ditch you and go have gelato all day while you wouldn't listen.

1192
01:56:51.065 --> 01:56:54.334
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): They have such fun flavors in a lot of too, not just the…

1193
01:56:54.445 --> 01:56:57.615
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): regular old boring flavors we have here. Well, it was so cool.

1194
01:56:57.615 --> 01:57:14.384
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): when we went to Ischia, like, they would… they were like, do you want to see our fresh, catch of the day? And they'd bring out everything, and they'd, like, hold up the fish. They're like, here's a flounder. There's probably two people, like, the fish, and then they cooked the fish and, like, brought it to you for lunch.

1195
01:57:14.385 --> 01:57:15.805
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): Oh, really?

1196
01:57:15.805 --> 01:57:16.545
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): So, I was.

1197
01:57:16.550 --> 01:57:17.680
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): all remotely.

1198
01:57:17.680 --> 01:57:18.060
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): would actually…

1199
01:57:18.065 --> 01:57:19.315
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): We test it out.

1200
01:57:19.315 --> 01:57:21.984
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Yeah. Yeah, I think I'm… I think I'm a buyer.

1201
01:57:21.990 --> 01:57:22.770
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): I like them.

1202
01:57:22.770 --> 01:57:34.769
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): People either love it or they hate it. I try to get everybody on those single wide. They're like, no, I need the seam, I want to be able to snap the windows. I'm like, you could still snap the windows, just not the seam.

1203
01:57:38.520 --> 01:57:39.709
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): I work just fine.

1204
01:57:40.040 --> 01:57:41.549
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Think about people.

1205
01:57:42.530 --> 01:57:45.409
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): Make a big review going on tonight, please.

1206
01:57:46.050 --> 01:57:47.000
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Is that everybody?

1207
01:57:47.160 --> 01:57:51.040
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): We're just waiting on Kimmy, but we can get started. Yeah, I'm just going through.

1208
01:57:51.045 --> 01:57:57.324
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): my lists, and I've gone through it a couple times, there's really only other one topic that we needed to touch on with CRM, and that's customer portal.

1209
01:57:58.045 --> 01:58:03.385
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): So we do have a customer portal that gives your… where you can give access to customers.

1210
01:58:03.515 --> 01:58:05.905
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): who are… Let's it.

1211
01:58:07.135 --> 01:58:09.805
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): They can see their open quotes there.

1212
01:58:09.985 --> 01:58:12.974
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): They could see open invoices,

1213
01:58:13.275 --> 01:58:16.274
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): I think we… I think we did enable punch.

1214
01:58:16.685 --> 01:58:18.324
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): So, it's just, it's a…

1215
01:58:18.565 --> 01:58:24.414
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): It's not super fancy. We have another version that we're working on, but it's… it covers the basics.

1216
01:58:24.415 --> 01:58:25.955
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): status reports.

1217
01:58:25.960 --> 01:58:27.979
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Yeah, you can publish a project extensive work.

1218
01:58:27.985 --> 01:58:34.075
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yep. Okay, so this… that's my big… I have two big things for you when it comes to client-facing. Project SaaS reports.

1219
01:58:34.660 --> 01:58:35.510
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): and…

1220
01:58:36.210 --> 01:58:38.760
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Accounting statements.

1221
01:58:39.250 --> 01:58:41.270
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): When do you want to talk about those two things?

1222
01:58:42.380 --> 01:58:45.029
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Well, you could do it right now since you have extra time. Okay.

1223
01:58:45.220 --> 01:59:01.249
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So, project status reports… right now, CORE will issue a project status report, but the team does not want to use that SAS report because it cannot be manipulated within CORE. So, while, yes, the ship date might say one thing, that might not be the shift date they want to show the client, for multiple reasons. Maybe something's coming

1224
01:59:01.250 --> 01:59:11.549
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): a bunch of stuff is coming before other things, but we want to do one delivery, and we don't want them to see that it's all going to be here, because then they'll want it delivered, or whatever. Oh, yeah. So I would like to be able to issue…

1225
01:59:11.780 --> 01:59:29.349
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): or in the product line, an acknowledge date, and a published date, and the status report showed the published dates. If the published date was left empty, it could just automatically pull the acknowledgement date. Does that make sense?

1226
01:59:29.570 --> 01:59:30.510
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Well…

1227
01:59:30.630 --> 01:59:45.099
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yeah, I mean, it depends. The other thing is sometimes we have to show a detailed status report. Sometimes we show a status report by manufacturer by date, because, right, Roll might give you 7 dates for one order. Yeah. So it just depends.

1228
01:59:45.105 --> 01:59:47.515
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): Is that more dependent on the client or on the vendor?

1229
01:59:48.350 --> 01:59:52.560
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): If you're showing them in different ways. The client, or…

1230
01:59:52.695 --> 01:59:57.084
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Or, most likely, it's the account manager, Who wants a.

1231
01:59:57.085 --> 02:00:01.564
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): a certain way. So you need some type of flexible reproduction tool that can do anything.

1232
02:00:01.565 --> 02:00:02.325
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): Sorry.

1233
02:00:02.325 --> 02:00:04.564
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Yes, of our channel.

1234
02:00:04.565 --> 02:00:06.825
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): I was gonna say that we can control.

1235
02:00:06.825 --> 02:00:07.904
Speaker 10 (Cornerstone): Well, it's not.

1236
02:00:07.905 --> 02:00:19.564
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): It's always good to give, like, all this granular detail to a client. Like, sometimes what we do on proposals is group things together, so they just see, like, here are your workstations. They don't need every single…

1237
02:00:19.565 --> 02:00:20.325
Speaker 10 (Cornerstone): I know I am a little.

1238
02:00:20.325 --> 02:00:28.075
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): literally paying people to type in Google Sheets what already exists in another system. Yeah. It drives me insane.

1239
02:00:28.755 --> 02:00:30.735
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yeah, they won't even export it.

1240
02:00:31.005 --> 02:00:32.435
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): It's certainly, it's certainly…

1241
02:00:32.435 --> 02:00:33.825
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Is there a version?

1242
02:00:34.195 --> 02:00:42.955
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Is there one… one version of those reports that's, like, that covers 80% of the use cases? Yes. Can we have a copy of that? Yes. Okay.

1243
02:00:43.265 --> 02:00:49.945
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Okay, the second thing… Let me just get the… for the transcript. So, we have a requirement for the project status report to be…

1244
02:00:50.535 --> 02:00:51.525
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Dynamic.

1245
02:00:51.695 --> 02:00:53.395
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): And user…

1246
02:00:54.935 --> 02:01:06.104
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): No, no, because actually, it's not dynamic, because they don't need to edit it, they're just… you just need to have them capture a publish date. It pulls a publish date, if it's there, if it's not, it falls back to the acknowledge date.

1247
02:01:06.110 --> 02:01:09.330
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Basically, we need an internal version and an external version. Yes.

1248
02:01:09.335 --> 02:01:10.785
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Yeah, that makes sense. Okay. Okay.

1249
02:01:11.035 --> 02:01:13.075
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): We'll need a solution designed for that.

1250
02:01:13.565 --> 02:01:14.305
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): customers.

1251
02:01:15.085 --> 02:01:33.894
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Accounting. Accounting statements. Yep. So, a lot of times, project management firms that work with clients have to show their value, and they love to do that in the most, annoying possible ways to us, and one of those is, is that we have to send all of our invoices to the PM firm first.

1252
02:01:34.035 --> 02:01:47.105
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): before they can go to the customer for payments. Okay. Because they want to, review them and, audit what they've paid to date, and so forth and so on. So right now.

1253
02:01:48.145 --> 02:01:59.045
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): That's very confusing, because on one project, we might have 20 orders, for whatever reason. We're ordering by floor, or we're ordering by stage, or we have labor, whatever the reason.

1254
02:01:59.255 --> 02:02:16.364
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And so, it's invoiced by each of those proposals, right? So it matches up to a proposal, but we have a deposit, or maybe they've made the 40%, but they're holding 10%, and so we're sending these invoices, but they don't actually… they don't always equal exactly what the proposal was.

1255
02:02:16.625 --> 02:02:26.655
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So then these PM firms that are hired to add value don't know how to actually do accounting, and so they just go, well, this doesn't match what the proposal is, so what is this?

1256
02:02:27.570 --> 02:02:31.060
Speaker 10 (Cornerstone): They don't even say that. It's just wrong. It's definitely wrong.

1257
02:02:31.065 --> 02:02:42.115
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So there… I got a report yesterday of what comes out of core, which is not dynamic at all, it's very flat, but then to make it work in a hurry, I just had to subtotal it.

1258
02:02:42.215 --> 02:02:44.165
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): by…

1259
02:02:44.765 --> 02:02:52.785
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I did it by order number, and here I'll show you what it looks like. And again, I don't know if this is… I didn't hear back after I sent this, so I'm assuming it worked.

1260
02:02:53.980 --> 02:02:55.919
Speaker 10 (Cornerstone): Just created one, too, for…

1261
02:02:56.320 --> 02:02:56.700
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Or…

1262
02:02:56.705 --> 02:02:57.465
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): Alright, piano.

1263
02:02:57.465 --> 02:03:01.275
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): But that was just… Well, this is the same one, so this is Auric.

1264
02:03:01.605 --> 02:03:08.074
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So, it basically shows the invoice number, and then it's subtotaled by…

1265
02:03:08.275 --> 02:03:13.874
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Order, and then it shows them, like, what the gross is, what the tax is, how much they've paid in deposit.

1266
02:03:13.965 --> 02:03:25.384
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): what's been paid and what's been opened, so they should all equal the same amount, so those are really old. So here's open stuff of, like, okay, this is what the total is, this is what they've paid.

1267
02:03:25.405 --> 02:03:38.614
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And this is what we haven't invoiced yet that we're going to invoice that we need them to pay. So basically, like, I need an accounting statement that shows you what you owed, how much you paid against it, and what you still owe, so that they can reconcile faster.

1268
02:03:41.485 --> 02:03:45.304
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): It's almost like a cover sheet for the invoices. Yeah.

1269
02:03:45.310 --> 02:03:46.330
Speaker 10 (Cornerstone): I'm done.

1270
02:03:46.580 --> 02:03:47.779
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): The percentage of.

1271
02:03:47.780 --> 02:03:55.469
Speaker 10 (Cornerstone): total that we're billing, because we had the situation, what Kip said, is that they were all confused, because their terms are 50-40-10,

1272
02:03:55.700 --> 02:04:07.900
Speaker 10 (Cornerstone): And they were all confused and said it was all wrong, but they were like, no, we just billed you the 40%, like, and nobody could figure that out, that that was 40%, because it didn't quite say anywhere that this is a 40% progress bill.

1273
02:04:07.905 --> 02:04:10.244
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): contract with SeaTimes.

1274
02:04:10.670 --> 02:04:19.039
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Well, or it's core, who likes to sometimes use to the third, and sometimes to the second, and sometimes to the sixth decimal, depending on which field you're.

1275
02:04:19.040 --> 02:04:29.449
Speaker 10 (Cornerstone): In this case, that wasn't… wasn't necessarily just the communication that this… this invoice represented 40%, like, that… that communication was off, so just… So when I look at that.

1276
02:04:30.830 --> 02:04:34.560
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): That's multiple customers associated with one customer, one product.

1277
02:04:34.560 --> 02:04:40.580
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Oh, these are all of the orders and invoices under one project.

1278
02:04:40.585 --> 02:04:42.694
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): So it's a customer statement.

1279
02:04:42.970 --> 02:04:46.390
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Or a project statement, however you want to… that makes it more straightforward.

1280
02:04:46.395 --> 02:04:55.415
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): NetSuite does it, as a customer statement. Yeah. Would that be okay if, like… Yeah, that was fine. Yeah. So you just need to… so it just needs to be modified to add a couple.

1281
02:04:55.415 --> 02:04:56.625
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): Yes, I was showing the…

1282
02:04:56.630 --> 02:05:01.279
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): the standard one, then you should go model. We'll go from that, yeah. Yeah, that'll be that one.

1283
02:05:01.285 --> 02:05:05.764
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Because right now, if you pull an accounting statement, customer accounting statement out of core.

1284
02:05:06.035 --> 02:05:13.954
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): It just shows it to you by individual invoice. It doesn't group it by order. So, as long as it groups it by order, that's all that really matters.

1285
02:05:14.110 --> 02:05:17.290
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Is that what the statement is, though?

1286
02:05:17.800 --> 02:05:18.940
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): Can you…

1287
02:05:18.940 --> 02:05:23.829
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Can you give us, though, like, an exact sample of what you want it to look like?

1288
02:05:24.130 --> 02:05:28.850
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yes, I can't give that to you today, but I can give that to you, because I will need input. Yep.

1289
02:05:29.165 --> 02:05:34.004
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): So, the requirement here is for a customized customer statement, and…

1290
02:05:34.590 --> 02:05:36.810
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): Matt will be giving us an example of it.

1291
02:05:37.190 --> 02:05:47.260
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): That brings up, and just in terms of statements, it made me think we're here because of that client. We can, NetSuite to progress buildings.

1292
02:05:47.830 --> 02:05:55.980
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): Yeah, okay, I could. Well… I figured it could. I mean, like, this client in particular had 50% deposit, 40% upon shipment, 10% upon completion.

1293
02:05:55.985 --> 02:05:59.074
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Well, it's an invoice schedule, they can do…

1294
02:05:59.075 --> 02:06:03.805
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): progress billing, that's a little… Did you leave the room earlier?

1295
02:06:04.590 --> 02:06:05.360
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): dinner?

1296
02:06:05.360 --> 02:06:10.359
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): Yes, it does. People on something.

1297
02:06:10.360 --> 02:06:13.980
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Well, we'll cover it in financial management, but progress drilling, if it's based on milestones.

1298
02:06:13.985 --> 02:06:18.795
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): I mean, back up and run over him again.

1299
02:06:18.795 --> 02:06:19.355
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): There's fabulous.

1300
02:06:19.355 --> 02:06:19.855
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): setup.

1301
02:06:21.485 --> 02:06:22.225
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Something else around.

1302
02:06:22.230 --> 02:06:28.919
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): They'll actually be able to put in their real terms, and it will invoice off of those terms, versus you having to figure out how to do that on a spreadsheet.

1303
02:06:29.530 --> 02:06:33.710
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): And then, do you want that customer statement to be published to the customer portal?

1304
02:06:34.405 --> 02:06:42.675
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So, here's the fun thing about customer portals, is people often ask us if we're capable, and again, we say yes, and then they never ask us to follow through on them. Yeah.

1305
02:06:42.675 --> 02:06:43.575
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): Just fake it.

1306
02:06:43.580 --> 02:06:48.669
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): in Google Slides, we show them a little image of a computer, and then on the computer…

1307
02:06:48.675 --> 02:06:55.794
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): the RFP, like, comparative, and they're like, they said yes, and then they move on. That's good. We've never actually used it.

1308
02:06:56.665 --> 02:07:00.255
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): If anything, what I would love is vendor portals.

1309
02:07:00.720 --> 02:07:01.310
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Yep.

1310
02:07:01.440 --> 02:07:07.990
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): You guys need vendor portals, because you have the contractors today. Yeah. So, yeah, we have the vendor portal.

1311
02:07:08.120 --> 02:07:13.159
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): partially made. I had 30% of them would have made. The front end's made.

1312
02:07:13.210 --> 02:07:23.190
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): What would probably happen is still, I mean, we do have… Some as often as, like, every week. They want it sent out on…

1313
02:07:23.390 --> 02:07:27.380
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): a Friday of every week. Oftentimes, our account managers are maybe, like.

1314
02:07:27.380 --> 02:07:46.069
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): if it's a big project, right? And they're like, we want to see it every Friday after the order's placed until the project's complete. What the account managers will do is customize it, because it's, again, line by line, or they'll simplify it, and maybe they only will highlight the lines that are at risk. And the customer just wants a screenshot of that, so…

1315
02:07:46.320 --> 02:07:59.650
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): if we're talking about the customer portal having that customer-facing piece, they might look at that, or it might just be that the account managers still are having to send it out weekly? I don't know, Alex, what do you think about that?

1316
02:08:02.680 --> 02:08:05.180
Alex Blangeres: Yeah, no, I'm with you.

1317
02:08:05.390 --> 02:08:13.650
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): I just think, like, portal, like, when we talk about it in an RFP, what they're asking for is different than what I'm saying is, like, the… The refinement.

1318
02:08:14.110 --> 02:08:18.219
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Yeah, because, like, a lot of customers do want project status reports.

1319
02:08:18.220 --> 02:08:18.970
Alex Blangeres: They do.

1320
02:08:19.245 --> 02:08:22.735
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yeah, so this is what a SAS report looks like. It gives you the order date.

1321
02:08:23.005 --> 02:08:28.305
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): If there's a PO, or sometimes it'll be… Do you think you're sharing your screen?

1322
02:08:28.310 --> 02:08:29.060
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): too.

1323
02:08:31.265 --> 02:08:35.045
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): You could let me go, that would have been quite funny.

1324
02:08:36.020 --> 02:08:38.850
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): Okay, so this is it. It's a…

1325
02:08:38.850 --> 02:08:43.740
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Google Sheet, And it just shows you all of the different things.

1326
02:08:43.860 --> 02:08:50.060
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And again, sometimes they manipulate this to be client-facing, M…

1327
02:08:51.160 --> 02:08:52.799
Cornerstone: We don't usually sh…

1328
02:08:52.800 --> 02:08:55.530
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Sometimes we will share directly from

1329
02:08:56.080 --> 02:09:02.029
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): like, give them access to the Google Sheet, but oftentimes we won't because there's no way for us to turn off rows.

1330
02:09:02.340 --> 02:09:06.190
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And we have internal notes that go on there.

1331
02:09:06.410 --> 02:09:10.950
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): But it just basically… this one is showing by line.

1332
02:09:11.950 --> 02:09:15.510
Cornerstone: And I can't tell what it's sorted by right now, but it's sorted.

1333
02:09:17.520 --> 02:09:19.130
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): And this is maintained.

1334
02:09:19.390 --> 02:09:22.459
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): manual thing. So you can imagine the amount of time.

1335
02:09:22.465 --> 02:09:25.024
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): One person in the Philippines that does this.

1336
02:09:25.710 --> 02:09:33.859
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): So, you said it's by line, so if an order has 100 lines, it'll be… 100 lines will be on this report? If it's exported directly, it would be…

1337
02:09:34.510 --> 02:09:39.369
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): But what we try to do is either group by area tag.

1338
02:09:40.480 --> 02:09:48.219
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So, like, events workstations, then anything tagged workstation, we would Given line for each shifting.

1339
02:09:48.870 --> 02:09:55.149
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So, they all have one ship date, then it's one line, but if it has multiple ship dates, then it would show a line for each ship date.

1340
02:09:56.720 --> 02:10:13.049
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): I just think there's, like, a little bit of a disc… when we talk about customer portals and RFPs, it's like, oh, you could find all your warranty information and your clean, you know, like, there's more nuance to it than just some of the things that we do need customers to see on, like, a weekly basis.

1341
02:10:13.050 --> 02:10:13.810
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): So it'd be nice.

1342
02:10:13.815 --> 02:10:19.745
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): have a version that, let's say, 90% of our customers would be fine with.

1343
02:10:20.055 --> 02:10:37.535
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And then an ability to export and to tailor when we need to into a manual process. I think that's more realistic than asking for you… more realistic financially for us, than asking you all to build out a custom status report portal within NetSuite.

1344
02:10:37.705 --> 02:10:44.315
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): We just need a sample of what you want it to look like, and my question here would be, in the case where there is multiple ship

1345
02:10:44.715 --> 02:10:51.695
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): dates, do you… would you want there to be multiple, lines? Or do you want that to be aggregated in one cell?

1346
02:10:52.125 --> 02:10:56.625
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): If it could show all of those ship dates in one cell, I would be fine with that. Yeah.

1347
02:10:56.630 --> 02:11:01.980
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): That's where… well, I mean, it's actually easier for us to do multiple rows. Multiple rows is fine.

1348
02:11:02.830 --> 02:11:06.799
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Okay. Yeah, if you can just give us an example of exactly what you want it to look like.

1349
02:11:08.030 --> 02:11:09.270
Cornerstone: We'll adopt us.

1350
02:11:09.960 --> 02:11:13.030
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Give you your own version. What does it look like, yours?

1351
02:11:13.470 --> 02:11:17.080
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Similar to that. Okay, I don't know if I have…

1352
02:11:18.080 --> 02:11:23.509
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): you know, we can pull it for you, though, if you want. Yeah, it's a project status report. It's… I mean, we should look at it.

1353
02:11:23.510 --> 02:11:30.680
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): at it and decide just your standard, yeah, what we'll do 90% of the time. Will you, just make a note for Chris to mention that?

1354
02:11:31.840 --> 02:11:37.310
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): The customer portal also allow for a customer to go in and see, like, order history, invoices.

1355
02:11:37.620 --> 02:11:50.530
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): Yeah. Is that something that's not an uncommon request. We'll get someone who says, you know, we're getting audited, and I need to know, will it be ordered in 2022, and you have to dig up all their invoices. Be nice…

1356
02:11:50.530 --> 02:11:52.999
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): I can't find these. Yeah.

1357
02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:55.559
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): It happens more than you think.

1358
02:11:55.565 --> 02:12:07.445
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Sometimes we exclude that information, too, because we're trying to save face with the client, and they don't… we don't want them to know exactly when we ordered a thing. Like, maybe there was a delay or something. That's what we talked about. Yeah, like, turning that off, you know?

1359
02:12:07.850 --> 02:12:11.710
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): Yeah, like, the customer portal core offers one, and we've gotten…

1360
02:12:11.840 --> 02:12:36.779
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): zero traction with it. Nobody really uses it. I think we have one… maybe one client who used it, but they… it's basically highly custom. It is neat, I mean, in their defense, so they do a pretty good job with it. You can toggle on and off fields, like, I don't want them to see shit data, I don't want them to see this, or I do want to, you know, so it's really… you can tailor it to a customer. Yeah. So that you get… they see what, you know, you want them to see. It's not static for every customer that sees the same

1361
02:12:36.780 --> 02:12:37.380
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): Hey.

1362
02:12:38.170 --> 02:12:41.889
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): We can just use the PDF Composer tool to generate those form, but you can…

1363
02:12:43.530 --> 02:12:49.140
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): make a note of that, too, because… so we have this tool, the PDF Composer tool, that has, you know, you have a template.

1364
02:12:49.550 --> 02:13:00.359
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): For, like, let's say a proposal, and it has all the available fields on there, then you pull up the PDF Composer tool and say, okay, well, I don't want everything, I just want this, this, and this, and take this off, and…

1365
02:13:00.500 --> 02:13:14.720
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): and dynamically on the fly, you can generate a proposal. And then maybe you want to reuse that set of configuration settings, you can save that as a separate template. Wondering if we could use our tool to generate the project.

1366
02:13:15.330 --> 02:13:21.219
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): And give the user the ability to kind of modify it on the fly. Okay. So we'll take a look at that.

1367
02:13:21.870 --> 02:13:31.010
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yeah, it's the number one thing that I get pushback on, and it's been brought up three times about, like, everything's gonna live in Orion. Well, what about SaaS renewals?

1368
02:13:31.460 --> 02:13:33.360
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): So… Did you hear that?

1369
02:13:33.365 --> 02:13:35.034
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): There's a lot of respect in that.

1370
02:13:38.195 --> 02:13:41.825
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): That's mostly Jill, and she's not on the call.

1371
02:13:43.700 --> 02:13:47.120
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Alright, well, that's actually everything for marketing and CRM.

1372
02:13:47.380 --> 02:13:48.589
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): That's real, was it?

1373
02:13:49.170 --> 02:13:49.800
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Okay.

1374
02:13:49.940 --> 02:14:00.589
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Can we, while we… since we just have a few minutes and we have marketing in the room, one of the things that I'm hoping to do is… we have a lot of Google Sheets or Asana worksheets for requests.

1375
02:14:00.930 --> 02:14:06.060
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Can we build an RFP request, or a marketing request, into…

1376
02:14:07.500 --> 02:14:15.669
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): NetSuite, Orion, and then also that be tied to the client. Yeah. So, like, I can see every marketing request ever made for a client.

1377
02:14:16.420 --> 02:14:17.549
Speaker 10 (Cornerstone): simple form, and I can.

1378
02:14:17.550 --> 02:14:19.740
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): can give you what the inputs are. Yep.

1379
02:14:19.745 --> 02:14:26.385
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): So we have the request engine, and it allows you to create any type of request form that you want inside of NetSuite. And then once that request.

1380
02:14:26.385 --> 02:14:31.774
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): comes in, Can it be moved into a project management? Like…

1381
02:14:33.080 --> 02:14:33.950
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): That's…

1382
02:14:34.930 --> 02:14:42.440
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): a tracking sheet, so, like, I can assign it, and it can go through phases, and there can be tasks assigned to it, and it just keeps building from there? Yeah.

1383
02:14:42.685 --> 02:14:48.844
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): So, the engine… we use the engine to create the labor quote, we use the engine to create the design request.

1384
02:14:49.495 --> 02:14:56.254
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): And it's extremely flexible, like, we can create statuses, have multiple sign-to's, the ability to email or not to email.

1385
02:14:56.890 --> 02:15:02.780
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): On the labor quote, because we don't have our own labor, can that still happen, and they select

1386
02:15:03.050 --> 02:15:07.859
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): from our preset, who they want to send the labor quote to. Yes. Request, basically.

1387
02:15:07.865 --> 02:15:13.824
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): external labor quote request, yep. Okay. And then email it out to… basically email it out for bid. Okay. Yep.

1388
02:15:14.230 --> 02:15:15.419
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): dashboard, because that's.

1389
02:15:15.420 --> 02:15:32.250
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): actually really how we're using Asana, so it's a way to filter the request, but then having the visual of what's on deck is so important to us. Like, being able to see… take a snapshot of that and say, okay, here's where we need to divert resources and energy based on.

1390
02:15:33.060 --> 02:15:34.920
Speaker 10 (Cornerstone): Scope of these projects.

1391
02:15:35.190 --> 02:15:35.800
Speaker 10 (Cornerstone): Yeah, it's.

1392
02:15:35.805 --> 02:15:43.304
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): One of the reasons why we have some of the dealers, they like using the handbags or the work boards. Yeah, I know how to use those. Okay, so…

1393
02:15:43.305 --> 02:15:44.805
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): It's just too hard. I'll tell you why.

1394
02:15:44.805 --> 02:15:56.804
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): It's just… it's actually too much, and it's, like, it would be great if you're just, like, being able to move around, but, like, it's just… we don't need that functionality. We do really need to see just a list, what it is, with the date.

1395
02:15:56.805 --> 02:15:57.564
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): only format.

1396
02:15:57.565 --> 02:15:59.805
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): It's a camo report. Will you take it? I…

1397
02:15:59.805 --> 02:16:04.525
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): You know I will adapt to whatever I need to adapt to. I'm here for you. But.

1398
02:16:05.170 --> 02:16:05.890
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): Question.

1399
02:16:06.210 --> 02:16:09.560
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): Oh, yeah.

1400
02:16:09.565 --> 02:16:12.554
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): And book all about the things.

1401
02:16:12.555 --> 02:16:13.305
Speaker 10 (Cornerstone): Yeah, you just want to take.

1402
02:16:13.305 --> 02:16:14.485
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): Well, you want a list.

1403
02:16:14.805 --> 02:16:17.064
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Give me the list. Just give me the facts.

1404
02:16:17.065 --> 02:16:18.104
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): I just need the facts of.

1405
02:16:18.105 --> 02:16:34.365
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): when it's due, with a link to the resources, to the project folder, to whatever, because then, when… pardon my language, but when shit hits the fan, we actually just take a snapshot of that, and we say, okay, how do we triage this? How do we get it all done? And that's it. I don't need to move it around, like…

1406
02:16:34.365 --> 02:16:38.415
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): You know? So it's just, like, not part of our functionality or workflow.

1407
02:16:38.584 --> 02:16:41.105
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): You should just see it in one place?

1408
02:16:41.105 --> 02:16:42.104
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Thank you so much to do that.

1409
02:16:42.105 --> 02:16:42.754
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): around.

1410
02:16:42.764 --> 02:16:43.294
Speaker 10 (Cornerstone): Yeah, yeah.

1411
02:16:43.299 --> 02:16:47.379
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Yeah, it's a… it's a tale with us. You got it. Question. That's easy.

1412
02:16:47.379 --> 02:16:47.949
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): That works for you.

1413
02:16:48.035 --> 02:16:48.625
Speaker 10 (Cornerstone): Yeah, yeah.

1414
02:16:48.629 --> 02:16:49.559
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Of course.

1415
02:16:49.669 --> 02:16:52.019
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): What happens when it's not new anymore?

1416
02:16:53.045 --> 02:16:56.264
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): I think it's a very simple, effective flow, so I would…

1417
02:16:56.535 --> 02:17:10.335
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): if we're talking, say, Sabrina or the next one, I don't imagine that changing. Okay. Like, she's so dialed on that, and it is kind of just, like, what a project manager would need, too. I think, like, an experienced project manager, just like, okay, I know what these things are, I know how to allocate.

1418
02:17:11.450 --> 02:17:17.200
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): But if it's going into, like, a Gantt chart flow, or in a task flow… So that would be different.

1419
02:17:17.205 --> 02:17:29.635
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): That is not the workflow of our team, but I could see how maybe the account management team, or maybe the design team needs that, but for the RFP side, and for the marketing side in general.

1420
02:17:29.855 --> 02:17:33.675
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): it's not that complicated. Like, there aren't these…

1421
02:17:33.684 --> 02:17:41.934
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): The complicated part, I understand, it's not that complicated. For me, I want to go in and be able to see availability.

1422
02:17:42.044 --> 02:17:48.734
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): and status between departments. So for you, yeah, you can just come and tell me what you're working on and what the status is.

1423
02:17:48.735 --> 02:17:59.455
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): you can see what it is and just assume that, like, when someone is working on a project for an RFP, there isn't a, phase of…

1424
02:17:59.594 --> 02:18:00.805
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): of…

1425
02:18:01.205 --> 02:18:07.034
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): effort. The whole thing is effort, because you have 10 days to do the thing, and it's all on board.

1426
02:18:07.035 --> 02:18:17.754
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So if your list was there, and then I clicked on that list, and it showed every task that you built out in your Google Sheet, could that Google Sheet live there, or does it stay in Google Sheet? We don't build out.

1427
02:18:17.760 --> 02:18:31.769
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): tasks. That way, we don't have to build those tasks out, because it's, like, such a specialized team that it's like, what are you doing? You're creating a lookbook, you're reviewing it, you're doing it. That actually makes more work to have to, like, build those out, those specific…

1428
02:18:31.775 --> 02:18:37.954
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): like, assigning tasks based off of what the RFP response is of who's in charge of what and when it gets done? Yes.

1429
02:18:37.959 --> 02:18:42.099
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): And no, the work that has to get done is always the same work.

1430
02:18:42.149 --> 02:19:01.729
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): it's always the same tasks, and it's always in the same order, so there's never a need to, like, repeat it or assign it, because you always do it in a specific order, which is why they could do it so quickly, and it's easy to communicate with them. It's different on a project… with a project, because, like, we'll say for design.

1431
02:19:02.309 --> 02:19:26.059
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): You have a bucket of deliverables that you have for a design project, but depending on the project variables, those deliverables can move around. So, maybe you need electrical drawings sooner than you do later, and in that model, for that team, they probably really do need, like, those milestones and those phases, because the energy level is different for the task.

1432
02:19:26.059 --> 02:19:29.799
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): But for RFPs and that, it's all the same energy level.

1433
02:19:29.809 --> 02:19:30.659
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Okay.

1434
02:19:31.219 --> 02:19:34.629
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Thank you for giving me the slur!

1435
02:19:34.855 --> 02:19:40.685
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Just so you know, it sounds like you don't need it, but just so you know what's available to you in that suite is, if it ever came up.

1436
02:19:41.155 --> 02:19:49.015
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): somebody creates a design request, we could automatically, and very easily, create a list of tasks that automatically get created. That's amazing.

1437
02:19:49.020 --> 02:19:54.519
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): And I'm actually… I'm also open to that for our team as well. Like, I think that's.

1438
02:19:54.525 --> 02:19:55.285
Speaker 10 (Cornerstone): Can I just have one.

1439
02:19:55.285 --> 02:19:57.545
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): time you did, so I didn't know that had changed.

1440
02:19:57.545 --> 02:19:58.725
Speaker 10 (Cornerstone): Dialed at this point.

1441
02:19:58.725 --> 02:20:08.784
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): But, you know, maybe we hire a new person out of the gate at some point, and they need that. So, I think having the capability is excellent, and I'm.

1442
02:20:08.785 --> 02:20:09.524
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): And what I go about.

1443
02:20:09.530 --> 02:20:26.970
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): mostly less for your team, most of the things that you… the tasks that you're waiting on others to do. So, like, you start a new RFP, and there's always the same things, and based off of the people that are on that RFP, it automatically assigns the account manager, the salesperson, so they know that they have shit to do.

1444
02:20:26.975 --> 02:20:27.625
Speaker 10 (Cornerstone): That's already in the.

1445
02:20:27.625 --> 02:20:47.155
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): in the form. But yes, yes, yes, there are certain things there, yes. But someone's still gonna have to manage it, because people don't always do what they need to do in time, because they're busy. Yeah. And so you will always have a human who has to be like, hey, so-and-so, I need you to… where are you at with that budget? I need it tomorrow by 3 p.m.

1446
02:20:48.170 --> 02:20:50.180
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): So, I think… That's true.

1447
02:20:50.180 --> 02:20:59.159
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Yeah. I will say that whenever we create a task, and you assign it to somebody, we have a task portlet that we put on their dashboard, so they could see, here's all the tasks that

1448
02:20:59.280 --> 02:21:15.790
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): due to me, and they could range across the company. And then, the nice thing about Safe Searches is you can do highlighting. So I can highlight this orange if it's coming due in two days, highlight it red if it's past due, things like that, so it's kind of interfacing the dashboard. Again, I just want you to know it's possible.

1449
02:21:15.795 --> 02:21:16.415
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): It's open to all.

1450
02:21:16.415 --> 02:21:17.904
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Yeah. Open.

1451
02:21:17.905 --> 02:21:18.795
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): to all of that.

1452
02:21:18.800 --> 02:21:25.399
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I think it's less for your team, maybe for others, but I'm also fine with the process we have in place now. I just want you to be aware.

1453
02:21:25.405 --> 02:21:31.414
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): to exploring all those things, and if there's a way to streamline anything that we're doing and eke out another day or two in the process, like.

1454
02:21:31.415 --> 02:21:35.895
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Well, also, it'd be way easier for us. Well, that's what I'm thinking.

1455
02:21:35.895 --> 02:21:36.655
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): If I could…

1456
02:21:36.655 --> 02:21:44.155
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): look and see what the project management dashboard is, the design, like, instead of looking at 17 different documents. Well, I'm thinking.

1457
02:21:44.155 --> 02:21:52.225
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): if you could go in and see, oh, here's sales and account management tasks that are past due, I need to go follow up with people that report to me. Yeah. Yeah.

1458
02:21:52.510 --> 02:21:53.919
Alex Blangeres: Yeah, that would be huge.

1459
02:21:54.590 --> 02:22:00.540
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): But also, when we're looking at, like, the bandwidth trackers and, like, all sorts of stuff.

1460
02:22:00.540 --> 02:22:05.070
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): to use tasks, which NetSuite makes it pretty easy to use tasks.

1461
02:22:05.070 --> 02:22:07.480
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): ask for design.

1462
02:22:07.670 --> 02:22:17.790
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): project management, okay, I want to use it for project coordination, I want to use it for everything, then I can if it makes sense, but that doesn't mean I'm going to make you use it if it doesn't make sense. Yeah, yeah.

1463
02:22:18.085 --> 02:22:19.555
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Time track on all the tests.

1464
02:22:19.785 --> 02:22:21.514
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): As well, so yeah, so…

1465
02:22:23.370 --> 02:22:25.649
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): The only time tracker design PMs.

1466
02:22:27.870 --> 02:22:29.879
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): You guys got a time tracker.

1467
02:22:29.885 --> 02:22:44.845
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): again, it's not on a task. And also, that just won't… I don't think that'll work because of the… how the team works, which… with… because there's overlap between people, so this team is a very specialized team that moves super fast on, like.

1468
02:22:44.845 --> 02:23:09.835
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): deliverables. They'll work on, like, 6 RFPs at one time, all due, like, within days of each other. And the way that that works and is effective is because they are this team that's been together for a long time, but they share things, and they'll pass them off. So, they'll be, like, a primary person who's responsible for a task, but they may get to a point in the task where it makes more sense from a time management standpoint for them to have another person finish it, and they go do the other thing

1469
02:23:09.835 --> 02:23:18.545
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): They're really good at. Yep. And so that's kind of how that speech works, which is where time tracking would be tricky, so they just track for the project, not the task.

1470
02:23:20.135 --> 02:23:24.924
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Good. But I love that there's an option there, and I would love to explore that, too.

1471
02:23:25.905 --> 02:23:31.165
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): I'm gonna build that team right now. Oh, there's that time, yes. Thank you, Jillian.

1472
02:23:31.170 --> 02:23:32.050
Speaker 11 (Cornerstone): speaker,

1473
02:23:32.055 --> 02:23:35.785
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Given me some space here. Absolutely. Thank you.

1474
02:23:38.050 --> 02:23:41.700
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): So I think we're good for today. Okay. Yep, we'll come back.

1475
02:23:41.860 --> 02:23:43.250
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): This term…

1476
02:23:43.870 --> 02:23:46.350
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): order what we have for tomorrow, because I think we changed the order, right?

1477
02:23:46.600 --> 02:23:49.080
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): We did move things around slightly…

1478
02:23:50.060 --> 02:24:02.740
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So tomorrow, we are starting with pre-quote activities. So, okay, tomorrow's gonna be chaos, just FYI. Perfect. We have this, we have all of our designers coming here for an all-hands that Ruffina.

1479
02:24:02.740 --> 02:24:16.129
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): It's supposed to be part of tomorrow morning's meeting, and I'm supposed to be part of tomorrow's meeting, but we also need to go kick off that all-hands that's gonna be next door, so we might be bouncing in and out. So, for design stuff, you might have to just…

1480
02:24:16.350 --> 02:24:20.939
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): focus on… Wendy and Shanna at first, and then we'll come meet you later.

1481
02:24:21.465 --> 02:24:29.214
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): In that session, the design… the pre-quote session? Yeah. That's design, and labor quoting, and site analysis, and…

1482
02:24:29.890 --> 02:24:39.000
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): assignment. I included Shanna because it shows team assignment management. A lot of times, PCs will start to allocate those resources based off of teams.

1483
02:24:40.980 --> 02:24:44.380
Speaker 10 (Cornerstone): Shannon Keating will be in that meeting, so I can probably carry it along.

1484
02:24:44.385 --> 02:24:45.255
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): Great. Yeah.

1485
02:24:45.450 --> 02:24:50.669
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So that's first, then we have order management at 1030.

1486
02:24:51.390 --> 02:25:00.700
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And then we have… lunch, which tomorrow will be pizza, because we're getting lunch for everybody, and then…

1487
02:25:01.150 --> 02:25:07.959
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): We have order management PO Acknowledgement after lunch, and then we have finance management at 2.30.

1488
02:25:08.600 --> 02:25:10.869
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): We're going to 80 tomorrow, right, Alex?

1489
02:25:11.210 --> 02:25:12.099
Alex Blangeres: What's that?

1490
02:25:12.310 --> 02:25:13.779
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Don't have any sessions tomorrow?

1491
02:25:13.780 --> 02:25:15.110
Alex Blangeres: No, we do not.

1492
02:25:15.110 --> 02:25:17.069
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): I think you guys are done.

1493
02:25:19.180 --> 02:25:23.269
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yeah, I think today was it for you. Kate, thanks for making the journey up.

1494
02:25:23.270 --> 02:25:27.699
Alex Blangeres: Yeah, we have, we have Friday, Matt. We have a business and reporting.

1495
02:25:27.700 --> 02:25:29.090
Speaker 10 (Cornerstone): and reporting.

1496
02:25:29.090 --> 02:25:30.130
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): Oh, I'm sorry, okay.

1497
02:25:30.135 --> 02:25:31.565
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yeah, one in Barton.

1498
02:25:31.845 --> 02:25:36.225
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And you can join that virtually. I will be. Okay.

1499
02:25:36.515 --> 02:25:37.645
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So then Friday.

1500
02:25:37.645 --> 02:25:45.124
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): hosting a huge IIDH. And this is. No, we're not doing that anymore, but he was not very happy with me. Don't get over it.

1501
02:25:46.085 --> 02:25:54.414
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I'll do something that will distract you from that. So then we have, we moved operations to back-to-back, so we have Operations 1 and Operations 2 Friday morning.

1502
02:25:54.635 --> 02:25:59.464
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Lunch, and then we have business intelligence reporting, and then we have wrap-up.

1503
02:26:00.040 --> 02:26:01.829
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): And operations will probably be late.

1504
02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:06.320
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Because we're actually going to cover some of it in pre-quote.

1505
02:26:07.100 --> 02:26:08.990
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): And then you guys don't actually do.

1506
02:26:09.240 --> 02:26:10.010
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Probably is…

1507
02:26:10.015 --> 02:26:13.104
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Do we want to move everything up and end earlier on Friday?

1508
02:26:13.680 --> 02:26:19.780
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Not a bad idea, because actually, I think your flight… Yeah, my flight's at 1230, so I don't have to leave. Oh, okay.

1509
02:26:19.785 --> 02:26:20.305
Speaker 12 (Cornerstone): away from here.

1510
02:26:20.305 --> 02:26:20.955
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): changer, but…

1511
02:26:20.960 --> 02:26:24.620
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): I try, it's nothing. That'd actually be good for you, too.

1512
02:26:24.625 --> 02:26:26.125
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): completely right.

1513
02:26:26.125 --> 02:26:30.115
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): I think I could have made it. It would have been tight, but it would… it certainly wouldn't hurt. Okay.

1514
02:26:30.115 --> 02:26:32.124
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Probably only need the one session for operations.

1515
02:26:32.125 --> 02:26:34.995
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So, I'm gonna cancel that.

1516
02:26:35.255 --> 02:26:37.514
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Are you gonna add zooms to these, or…

1517
02:26:38.440 --> 02:26:40.410
Speaker 10 (Cornerstone): I think you said Friday for the G.

1518
02:26:40.410 --> 02:26:41.160
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): Agents need to see.

1519
02:26:41.165 --> 02:26:43.035
Speaker 10 (Cornerstone): I already, there's already one of you.

1520
02:26:43.040 --> 02:26:43.739
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Well, that's been changing.

1521
02:26:43.740 --> 02:26:45.890
Alex Blangeres: Yeah, there are things attached.

1522
02:26:46.410 --> 02:26:47.969
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): Got it.

1523
02:26:48.380 --> 02:26:53.209
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): And we're going to still try and do the event, we're just gonna… what time do you think it'll be done?

1524
02:26:53.810 --> 02:26:55.149
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): I think, at least.

1525
02:26:55.260 --> 02:26:55.820
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): No.

1526
02:26:55.825 --> 02:26:59.615
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): the event we were supposed to have here tonight. We were gonna have it.

1527
02:26:59.615 --> 02:27:01.475
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Kansas ending at 2.30.

1528
02:27:01.625 --> 02:27:02.405
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): different.

1529
02:27:04.295 --> 02:27:13.964
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So we have one and a half hours for operations, one and a half hours for business intelligence and reporting, working lunch, and then one and a half hours for wrap-up and accepts.

1530
02:27:13.965 --> 02:27:17.024
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): The wrap-up could actually happen during the opening lunch, most likely.

1531
02:27:17.030 --> 02:27:19.769
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yeah, so we could be done as early as…

1532
02:27:24.910 --> 02:27:28.770
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): I couldn't put my glasses on, but this is…

1533
02:27:29.160 --> 02:27:35.399
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): If it was an hour and a half and we'd move it up an hour, it'd be done at 2 o'clock then.

1534
02:27:36.960 --> 02:27:39.530
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Or 1.30, sorry, it'd be done at 1.30. Yeah.

1535
02:27:40.440 --> 02:27:43.250
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So do we want to do that? Yeah. Okay.

1536
02:27:45.750 --> 02:27:48.000
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Order management is the biggest… Yeah.

1537
02:27:48.100 --> 02:27:51.269
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): necessary. But I think we had two sessions for that.

1538
02:27:51.390 --> 02:27:52.920
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): So, we're in good shape there.

1539
02:27:53.080 --> 02:27:53.700
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): V…

1540
02:27:53.705 --> 02:27:54.325
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): do.

1541
02:27:54.595 --> 02:27:56.945
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Quote to order and PO to acknowledgement.

1542
02:27:57.510 --> 02:28:00.090
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): I was actually surprised by an institution, like…

1543
02:28:00.470 --> 02:28:07.949
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): It's only because we end up touching on it so many times throughout all the other process areas, and then…

1544
02:28:08.490 --> 02:28:10.590
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): I also find that,

1545
02:28:11.370 --> 02:28:20.980
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): it's better to have some of those in-depth sessions with just the finance people, because everybody else starts to fall asleep, and then… Not me, Lorraine. I know.

1546
02:28:20.985 --> 02:28:21.724
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): It's deep enough.

1547
02:28:21.730 --> 02:28:26.590
Speaker 10 (Cornerstone): I can sense it. GoPatriot. Finance is still the star.

1548
02:28:26.590 --> 02:28:28.510
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Absolutely.

1549
02:28:29.540 --> 02:28:32.120
Cornerstone: Alex, are you okay with that 1030 change?

1550
02:28:32.120 --> 02:28:38.239
Alex Blangeres: Yeah, that's fine. Kate, we'll just have to move our HR meeting, but yeah, that's not a big deal, we can…

1551
02:28:38.240 --> 02:28:42.170
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): If the two of you would stop acting up, you won't have to have an HR meeting.

1552
02:28:42.610 --> 02:28:45.430
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): It's our baby's… I know what it is.

1553
02:28:45.430 --> 02:28:46.090
Speaker 10 (Cornerstone): these.

1554
02:28:46.090 --> 02:28:52.840
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): I was gonna say it's our babysitting check-in, but it's because we have babies.

1555
02:28:53.700 --> 02:29:01.849
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Okay. What time is that? I'm, like… I have the hottest mess of a Friday ever, but it's okay, I'll make it work.

1556
02:29:01.850 --> 02:29:06.299
Speaker 10 (Cornerstone): She's got about 6 things on one time. See it from here!

1557
02:29:06.840 --> 02:29:11.980
Speaker 10 (Cornerstone): Okay, let me put an arm off for this one, a leg for this one.

1558
02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:15.689
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Plus, yeah, we have an event at our showroom.

1559
02:29:18.010 --> 02:29:18.970
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): End.

1560
02:29:19.180 --> 02:29:24.470
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): I'm still managing the cable, or Mina's managing the catering purpose, but…

1561
02:29:25.360 --> 02:29:26.600
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Did you say that we would be wrapping?

1562
02:29:26.605 --> 02:29:32.234
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): up on Friday? We will be done now if we use the full amount of time at 1.30.

1563
02:29:36.995 --> 02:29:40.535
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): His operation's gonna take a full hour if we're not talking about warehousing?

1564
02:29:41.360 --> 02:29:43.660
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): I don't think it's gonna take that long, actually.

1565
02:29:44.560 --> 02:29:46.769
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): We're just looking at flights, a full hour and a half.

1566
02:29:46.775 --> 02:29:51.574
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): What flight are you looking at? Hey, the sooner you go, the less I pay, so I'm okay with it.

1567
02:29:51.575 --> 02:29:53.075
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Too good.

1568
02:29:53.075 --> 02:29:56.384
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So you would need to leave here by noon?

1569
02:29:56.975 --> 02:30:03.045
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): 1230. Are you gonna take BART to the airport? Or are you flying out of Oakland or SFL?

1570
02:30:03.395 --> 02:30:07.445
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): SFO. So if you took the bar to the airport, you could get there in a half hour.

1571
02:30:07.875 --> 02:30:10.884
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And the BART pickup is a block away.

1572
02:30:11.035 --> 02:30:16.024
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Which would be much faster than you taking an Uber, most likely, on Friday. Probably cheaper.

1573
02:30:16.355 --> 02:30:17.145
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Yes. Yeah.

1574
02:30:17.145 --> 02:30:18.395
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): In the city, yes.

1575
02:30:19.760 --> 02:30:20.900
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): Is it not safe.

1576
02:30:21.630 --> 02:30:24.259
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Right? Nowhere. It's all fine. Everything's good.

1577
02:30:25.010 --> 02:30:28.120
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): If we do the 255 fight, we don't have to do the right-eyed.

1578
02:30:28.430 --> 02:30:30.260
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): healing to us. Yeah, let's made that happen.

1579
02:30:31.180 --> 02:30:31.770
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And it's…

1580
02:30:31.770 --> 02:30:37.190
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): That's what I was looking at, too. I'm like, that goes from a 5-hour flight to a 14-hour flight. It's like, whoa.

1581
02:30:37.765 --> 02:30:40.884
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Okay, so I'll escape, can you do 10 o'clock?

1582
02:30:43.090 --> 02:30:43.660
Alex Blangeres: Yeah.

1583
02:30:44.230 --> 02:30:47.789
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): I can. I'll move… I have a meeting with Andrea, but I have moved.

1584
02:30:47.795 --> 02:30:48.714
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): Yeah, I'll see him.

1585
02:30:48.730 --> 02:30:50.460
Alex Blangeres: Yeah.

1586
02:30:50.680 --> 02:30:51.620
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Journal?

1587
02:30:51.830 --> 02:30:52.919
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Not worried about.

1588
02:30:53.710 --> 02:30:55.440
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Okay, you're good, Alex?

1589
02:30:55.440 --> 02:30:55.980
Alex Blangeres: Yep.

1590
02:30:56.820 --> 02:31:00.140
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Okay, so that now… we now finish at 1 o'clock, okay?

1591
02:31:01.870 --> 02:31:03.570
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): You guys have TSA PreCheck?

1592
02:31:04.590 --> 02:31:08.440
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Not clear. You'll be fine at SFO with Clear.

1593
02:31:09.640 --> 02:31:12.229
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): Faster, but you get a lot more haters.

1594
02:31:12.450 --> 02:31:21.629
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): Yeah. I have clear, too, and I just… I can't bring myself to use it, because I see the looks those people get, but it's just, like, blind cutting. I don't care!
