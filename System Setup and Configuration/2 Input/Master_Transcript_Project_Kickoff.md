### QUESTIONS & ANSWERS FROM KICKOFF

**Q: Discovery timeline?**
A: 6-8 weeks, flexible based on client pace and availability. Not an area to rush.

**Q: What systems replaced besides Core?**
A: Zendesk, Excel reports, Google Sheets, workload documents, project tracking, time entry. Asana evaluation ongoing (likely still used for task management, but may reduce).

**Q: Will Paylocity go away?**
A: No, HR/payroll separate from NetSuite. May change platforms but will remain separate with CSV journal entry imports.

**Q: Google Drive documents?**
A: Still in Drive but linkable directly from NetSuite projects. Bi-directional integration available.

**Q: Financial data - how far back?**
A: 2017 forward confirmed. Can go back to mid-2000s if needed (KB workspace start, Hoag workspace TBD). End-of-month trial balances imported.

**Q: How many Core implementations?**
A: ~80% of dealer implementations are from Core. Have data extraction tool and strategy to avoid Core involvement.

**Q: Core cooperation?**
A: Strategy to request information without "tipping them off." SQL backend access available. Joe Keller has extraction tool and specific email wording approach.

**Q: What customizations typical?**
A: 5-10% vs. 50% for standard NetSuite. Usually minor (specific reports, fields). Orion handles most requirements out-of-box.

**Q: Dealer similarities/differences?**
A: All doing the same thing but differently. Orion built for flexibility and configurability. Can accommodate unique strategic advantages.

**Q: Training approach?**
A: Multiple formats (live recorded, documentation, videos, user guides). Client has good training culture with department leads. Will identify NetSuite champions for peer support.
