## Executive Summary

KBM Hoag is implementing Orion, a proven NetSuite-based solution specifically designed for contract furniture dealers, to modernize their business operations and replace their legacy Core ERP system. This Business Requirements Document validates the alignment between KBM Hoag's business requirements and Orion's comprehensive capabilities, demonstrating how the proven solution will effectively support their operational, financial, and strategic needs.

The analysis of discovery findings reveals that **88% of requirements align directly with Orion's standard functionality**, requiring minimal customization. Only **4% of requirements require custom development** (Expensify automation and archive system), both addressing specific efficiency objectives. This exceptional alignment validates the selection of Orion as the appropriate solution and supports an efficient, risk-managed implementation using the proven DREAM methodology.

This implementation will be structured around a soft cutover approach, allowing KBM Hoag to start new business in NetSuite while completing existing projects in their legacy Core system, providing a natural, low-risk transition over approximately 6 months. The partnership between GSI and KBM Hoag emphasizes strong change management, comprehensive training, and post-go-live support to ensure successful adoption and long-term value realization.

  - Proven 5-phase implementation framework reducing risk through structured governance
  - Balanced approach: GSI-heavy Realize phase minimizes client disruption; Client-heavy Educate phase ensures competency

### 1.2 Current State Process

KBM Hoag currently operates with divided governance structures across multiple legacy systems. Project decisions require coordination across the Core ERP system, various point solutions, and manual spreadsheet processes. Escalation paths are sometimes unclear, and response times on decisions can extend timelines. Change management has been informal, with department leads managing communication but without centralized coordination. The absence of formal governance structure and change management function creates risk in large-scale transformation initiatives.

### 1.3 Orion/NetSuite Solution

Orion/NetSuite provides comprehensive implementation governance capabilities through the proven DREAM methodology, which has been successfully deployed across multiple contract furniture dealer implementations. The framework includes built-in project governance structures (dual sponsorship, program management, workstream organization) that align with how organizations typically operate, reducing the learning curve for governance itself.

The DREAM framework is specifically designed for implementations of this scope and complexity, providing structured gates between phases, clear decision points, and defined deliverables. GSI's implementation of DREAM with KBM Hoag establishes executive sponsorship with clearly defined authority (Sean Scanlon for GSI, Matt for KBM Hoag), enabling decisions at the appropriate level without requiring consensus on every item. The structured methodology includes formal change control processes, documented escalation procedures, and regular status reporting cadences that maintain transparency and alignment throughout the implementation.

Orion's implementation approach leverages proven patterns from furniture dealer implementations, allowing GSI to work more efficiently and KBM Hoag to benefit from industry best practices without extensive custom governance design.

### 1.4 Future State Process

The DREAM methodology will structure project governance with clear roles, responsibilities, and decision authority. Executive sponsorship will provide strategic oversight and escalation path, while Lorraine (Program Manager) will coordinate internal resources and manage task execution. Kimmy (Change Management Lead) will drive user adoption strategy, identify internal champions, and lead department-specific communication approaches. Functional workstream leads will represent their areas in discovery sessions and validate requirements from their domains. This clear governance structure will replace ad-hoc decision-making with structured processes, enabling faster resolution and better stakeholder alignment.

### 2.2 Current State Process

Currently, KBM Hoag operates with informal requirements gathering. Requirements are often captured in departmental conversations, spreadsheets, and email threads. There is no centralized requirements repository, making it difficult to track what has been analyzed and what remains. Documentation of requirements is inconsistent across departments. There is no formal validation process confirming that captured requirements are accurate and complete.

### 2.3 Orion/NetSuite Solution

Orion/NetSuite provides a comprehensive discovery framework designed specifically for implementations where significant portion of requirements are already built into the pre-configured solution. Rather than starting from scratch and building everything, the DREAM discovery process validates which Orion capabilities meet requirements and identifies the specific areas that may need customization or configuration.

The structured two-part discovery session format employed by GSI—first showing Orion's capabilities and workflows, then conducting detailed requirements analysis—allows participants to provide more informed requirements. Participants understand what's possible in NetSuite before committing to specific approaches, reducing the likelihood of requirements based on legacy system limitations rather than true business needs.

The comprehensive 6-8 week discovery timeline with 1.5-2 hour sessions across 8 process areas ensures thorough coverage. AI-assisted transcription of all sessions—backed by backup recording devices—creates documentation that accurately captures discussions, evidence, and rationale. This transcript-based documentation becomes the foundation for professional BRDs that include both business context and implementation details, ensuring stakeholders have clear understanding of how Orion addresses their requirements.

### 2.4 Future State Process

The DREAM discovery process will systematically analyze all 8 process areas through structured 1.5-2 hour sessions with department leads and functional experts. Each session will first demonstrate relevant Orion capabilities, then conduct detailed requirements analysis and gap assessment. All sessions will be recorded and transcribed, creating a complete documentation trail. From this session documentation and detailed analysis, comprehensive Business Requirements Documents will be created for each process area, reviewed collaboratively with KBM Hoag stakeholders, and signed off as the implementation blueprint.

  - Chart of accounts is the foundation for all financial configuration
  - Must be established before other financial configuration begins
  - Enables clean financial data entry and reporting from day one

- **REQ-013**: Reduce chart of accounts from 40+ pages to few hundred accounts (ADAPT)
  - Current Core system chart of accounts has accumulated excessive granularity over time
  - NetSuite approach uses combinations of GL accounts and dimensions (department, location, class) for reporting
  - Consolidation from 40+ pages to few hundred accounts while maintaining reporting capability
  - Requires finance team process changes to use dimension-based reporting

- **REQ-014**: Configure NetSuite Financial Premium SKU with Advanced Inventory Module (ALIGNS)
  - NetSuite Financial Premium (formerly Retail Premium) includes Advanced Inventory Module
  - Provides inventory management, multi-location support, and advanced costing methods
  - Includes all necessary functionality for contract furniture dealer operations

### 3.2 Current State Process

KBM Hoag currently operates Core ERP with largely default system configurations plus accumulated customizations. The chart of accounts has grown to 40+ pages, reflecting years of incremental account additions without periodic consolidation. They use standard system roles without significant customization. Forms and workflows are minimally customized from standard Core templates. The system relies on multiple integrations to point solutions to compensate for limitations in standard functionality.

### 3.3 Orion/NetSuite Solution

Orion/NetSuite provides a pre-configured system specifically designed for contract furniture dealers, dramatically reducing the configuration burden compared to implementing standard NetSuite. The 5 pre-installed Suite Apps deliver furniture-specific functionality across order management (BOM Import Tool, Smart Table), financial management (Project Record, Commission Module), CRM (Opportunity Cards, Customer Portal), and operations (Operations Suite, Punch Record). This pre-built functionality means that instead of custom development, KBM Hoag benefits from proven solutions already deployed at similar dealers.

The 25+ custom Orion roles are pre-configured to represent typical organizational structures in furniture dealer businesses (Sales, Order Management, Operations, Finance, Executive, Administrative roles). These roles provide appropriate access controls without requiring extensive role definition sessions—roles simply need to be mapped to users based on their job function. The pre-built role structure reduces configuration time and ensures consistent security policies aligned to industry best practices.

Orion's custom forms and fields are specifically designed around furniture dealer business processes—from quote management through installation and service. These pre-built forms reduce configuration time significantly compared to designing forms from scratch. Pre-built workflows automate standard processes like approval chains, order routing, and work order management, providing immediate process improvement without requiring custom development.

The chart of accounts streamlining from 40+ pages to a few hundred accounts reflects modern ERP best practices. NetSuite's dimension functionality (Department, Location, Class) replaces the need for account-level granularity. For example, instead of having separate GL accounts for "New York Sales - Furniture" and "Boston Sales - Furniture," one could use a single "Sales - Furniture" account with Department and Location dimensions. This consolidation improves account reconciliation, reduces month-end close complexity, and maintains full reporting capability through NetSuite's multi-dimensional reporting.

### 3.4 Future State Process

During the Realize phase, GSI will work with KBM Hoag finance team to map the current 40+ page chart of accounts to a consolidated structure of a few hundred accounts using dimension-based organization. The 5 Orion Suite Apps will be installed into the NetSuite Financial Premium instance. The 25+ pre-built Orion roles will be configured in the system and mapped to KBM Hoag users based on job function. Pre-built custom forms and furniture-specific workflows will be activated and validated. This foundation enables all subsequent configuration.

  - Custom archive system needed for historical data not migrated to NetSuite
  - Accessible for reference but through different interface than live NetSuite data
  - Requires user training on access methodology

### 4.2 Current State Process

**PROCESS**: Historical Data Access in Core System  
**TRIGGER**: User needs historical financial or project information  
**STEPS**:
1. User searches Core database with known search criteria → quick location of records
2. User accesses complete historical detail → reviews project/financial information as needed
3. System provides instant access → user completes task

**PAIN POINTS**: Post-migration, very old data (pre-2017) will require accessing separate archive system; different search methodology will require user adjustment

### 4.3 Orion/NetSuite Solution

Orion/NetSuite provides comprehensive data migration capabilities for period-over-period financial reporting. The 2017+ trial balance import using CSV ensures KBM Hoag maintains clean historical data for financial analysis and forecasting. This trial balance approach—importing summarized month-end data rather than detailed transactions—is particularly effective for historical financial data, as it provides reporting capability without requiring detailed transaction-level migration.

The SQL backend access to Core data (confirmed through Joe Keller's extraction tool) allows efficient, direct extraction without requiring Core vendor involvement. This approach respects KBM Hoag's need to complete data migration without ongoing Core system costs or vendor dependencies. The streamlined extraction process enables faster migration and reduces support requirements.

For data prior to 2017, Orion/NetSuite enables establishment of a separate archive system—potentially cloud-based storage or a dedicated database—that maintains accessibility for historical reference and RFP responses without requiring those transactions to consume NetSuite storage and performance resources. This two-tier approach—current data in NetSuite, archived data accessible through separate system—reflects industry best practices for managing large historical datasets.

### 4.4 Future State Process

During the Realize phase, GSI will work with Joe Keller to extract Core financial data using the SQL backend approach. KB workspace financial trial balances from 2017 forward will be imported into NetSuite via CSV. Hoag workspace historical data import range will be determined by Lorraine, with similar CSV import process. Pre-2017 data will be exported to a separate archive system designed for easy reference and lookup. Post-migration, users needing very old historical data will access the archive system while current and recent historical data (2017+) will be accessible through NetSuite's standard financial queries and reports.

### 5.3 Orion/NetSuite Solution

Orion/NetSuite provides proven integration architecture specifically designed for contract furniture dealer operations. The Exemplis integration with Miller Knoll (already completed) demonstrates the integration platform's capability. The pre-built integration framework enables rapid implementation of additional manufacturer integrations as vendor participation is obtained.

The Bank Feeds and Electronic Bill Payments Suite Apps automate cash management processes, eliminating manual bank transaction entry and reconciliation. These standard NetSuite apps have been proven across thousands of implementations and provide reliable, secure banking integration.

For payroll integration with Paylocity (or alternative HR platform), NetSuite enables CSV import of journal entries, maintaining financial system integration without requiring the payroll system to store financial detail. This approach accommodates the separation between HRIS and ERP while ensuring financial accuracy.

The Expensify integration automation (REQ-024) will eliminate the current manual Excel download/upload process. A custom integration will automatically flow expense data from Expensify into NetSuite, enabling real-time expense visibility and automated approval workflows. This integration removes manual touches, reduces errors, and enables better expense policy enforcement.

The Google Drive bi-directional integration (subject to the Google Drive vs SharePoint decision) will make file storage accessible directly from NetSuite transactions. Employees can store and retrieve project documents, quotes, and work orders without leaving NetSuite, improving workflow efficiency and document organization.

### 5.4 Future State Process

Banking integration will automatically import transactions from West Coast Community Bank and process bill payments through NetSuite, enabling near-real-time cash visibility and reducing reconciliation time. Payroll integration (via Paylocity or alternative) will automatically import gross pay and tax withholding journal entries into NetSuite's financial system, maintaining accurate payroll expense tracking without manual entry. Expense management will be automated through Expensify integration, allowing employees to submit expenses which automatically flow to NetSuite for approval and accounting. File storage will be accessible directly from NetSuite, with project documents, proposals, and work orders linked to relevant transactions. Manufacturer integrations will expand over time as additional vendors commit to participation.

### 6.3 Orion/NetSuite Solution

Orion/NetSuite training approach leverages KBM Hoag's existing training culture as foundation, building upon successful patterns. Rather than replacing the department-led training model, Orion implementation enhances it with professional training delivery methods and comprehensive documentation.

The multi-format training approach (live recorded sessions, written guides, videos, self-service materials) recognizes that different users have different learning preferences and constraints. Some users learn better through instructor-led training, others through written procedures, others through video demonstration. By providing training in multiple formats—all captured for ongoing reference—KBM Hoag ensures accessibility for all learning styles while building a documentation library for ongoing training of new hires or refresher training.

The NetSuite Champions program leverages enthusiasm and capability within KBM Hoag to create internal support capability. Rather than depending on GSI consultants indefinitely for questions and changes, identifying and intensively training 2-3 power users per department enables peer-to-peer support. Champions become the first line of support for colleagues, with consultants supporting champions on more complex issues. This approach reduces support costs, empowers internal teams, and creates a sustainable long-term support model.

User Acceptance Testing during the Educate phase is essential to validating that the system meets business requirements before go-live. UAT allows users to execute their actual workflows against the configured system, identify issues before production, and build confidence in the system's ability to support their work.

### 6.4 Future State Process

During the Realize phase, GSI will work with department leads to develop training content for NetSuite workflows. This training will be delivered in Educate phase through multiple formats: live instructor-led sessions (recorded for reference), written process decks with step-by-step procedures, accompanying videos providing visual walkthroughs, and searchable knowledge base for on-demand reference. NetSuite Champions will be identified early (by Kimmy in collaboration with department leads) and will receive intensive additional training enabling them to support peers. Department-specific training sessions will be delivered to sales, operations, finance, and other teams, with role-specific content addressing their actual workflows. User Acceptance Testing will be conducted with business users executing real scenarios against configured system, identifying and addressing any gaps before go-live.

## 7. COMMUNICATION & COLLABORATION

### 7.1 Your Business Requirements

- **REQ-032**: Use Microsoft Teams as primary communication platform (KBM joins GSI Teams) (ALIGNS)
  - Centralized project communication and collaboration
  - Chat threads for ongoing discussions by topic
  - File sharing and meeting coordination
  - KBM Hoag joining GSI Teams environment for integration

- **REQ-033**: Establish weekly status reporting cadence (ALIGNS)

- **REQ-035**: Record all sessions with backup recording devices (ALIGNS)
  - Complete session recording ensuring comprehensive documentation
  - Multiple recording devices (video + backup pin recorder) for reliability
  - Enables transcript creation and builds documentation library

- **REQ-036**: Generate AI-assisted transcripts for all sessions to build BRDs (ALIGNS)
  - Accurate transcription of all sessions supporting BRD development
  - AI-assisted approach enables rapid transcript generation
  - Transcripts become source for requirement documentation

- **REQ-037**: Implement change control process with change orders post-discovery scope lock (ALIGNS)
  - Formal scope definition at end of Discovery phase
  - Change orders required for any new requirements or scope changes
  - Impact on timeline documented for any approved changes
  - Client sign-off discipline enforces scope integrity

### 7.2 Current State Process

**PROCESS**: Project Communication (Current State)  
**TRIGGER**: Project team coordination needed  
**STEPS**:
1. Email or ad-hoc meetings → scattered communication across multiple channels
2. Information stored in various locations → difficult to locate or reference
3. Status updates informal → no regular cadence
4. Change requests informal → scope creep potential

**PAIN POINTS**: 
- Communication fragmented across email, chat, calls, in-person meetings
- Difficult to locate past decisions and discussions
- Status visibility inconsistent
- Scope creep from informal change process

### 7.3 Orion/NetSuite Solution

Orion/NetSuite implementation uses Microsoft Teams as the centralized collaboration platform, providing single source of truth for project communication. Rather than scattered email, Teams organizes discussions by channel (by discovery area, functional team, or topic), making it easy to locate past discussions and decisions. File sharing through Teams integrates documents with conversations, providing context for decisions.

Weekly status reporting provides regular stakeholder visibility into project progress, risks, and upcoming activities. This cadence—frequent enough to catch issues early, not so frequent as to create meeting fatigue—maintains executive engagement without excessive overhead. Status reports document accomplishments, risks/issues, and planned activities, enabling quick stakeholder decision-making.

Flexible working session scheduling (weekly to 3x per week) adapts to project phase and organizational constraints. During Discovery phase, sessions may be more frequent (2-3x per week during active discovery), then adjust as project moves through Realize and Educate phases. Business cycle considerations ensure that Finance team is available during appropriate times (not during month-end close, for example).

Complete session recording with multiple backup devices ensures comprehensive documentation. Video recordings capture not just what was discussed but body language and whiteboard discussions. Transcription provides searchable text of all sessions. This comprehensive documentation creates a complete audit trail of discovery discussions, supporting both BRD development and post-implementation reference for how decisions were made.

Change control process with formal scope lock after Discovery establishes project boundaries and ensures that scope changes are managed deliberately rather than creeping in informally. Change orders document new requirements or scope changes, assess impact on timeline/budget, and obtain client sign-off before execution. This discipline protects both GSI and KBM Hoag from unplanned scope expansion.

### 7.4 Future State Process

Microsoft Teams will be set up as the primary communication platform with GSI and KBM Hoag collaboration channels organized by discovery area and functional team. Weekly status reporting will occur on a set day/time, with brief written status plus executive summary discussion. Working sessions will be scheduled at appropriate cadence (to be determined but typically 2-3x per week during Discovery, 1x per week during Realize/Educate). All sessions will be recorded in HD video plus backup pin recorder, with automatic transcription available within hours of session completion. Any new requirements or scope changes after Discovery phase will be documented in change order format, impact assessed, and client sign-off obtained before execution.

## 8. GO-LIVE STRATEGY & TRANSITION

### 8.1 Your Business Requirements

- **REQ-038**: Execute soft cutover go-live strategy (not hard cutover) (ALIGNS)
  - New business starts in NetSuite on go-live date
  - Existing projects continue in Core until completion
  - Phased transition reducing risk of disrupting in-flight work
  - Natural transition as Core projects complete

- **REQ-039**: Start new business in NetSuite on go-live date while completing existing projects in Core (ADAPT)
  - Dual-system operations during transition period
  - New opportunities, quotes, orders begin in NetSuite
  - Existing Core projects continue to completion
  - Users manage processes in both systems temporarily

- **REQ-040**: Plan for ~6 month dual-system period during transition (ADAPT)
  - Typical timeframe for Core project completion and transition
  - Gradual wind-down of Core usage as projects complete
  - Allows natural project migration rather than forced cutover

- **REQ-041**: Migrate projects from Core to NetSuite in phases where possible (ADAPT)
  - Projects migrated when natural project boundaries allow
  - Some projects may complete in Core before sunset
  - Others may be migrated mid-stream if appropriate
  - No forced wholesale project migration

- **REQ-042**: Provide on-site or Microsoft Teams channel support during go-live (ALIGNS)
  - Support presence during cutover weekend
  - Option for on-site support in Reno location or remote Teams channel support
  - Immediate issue resolution during critical go-live period

- **REQ-043**: Include 30 days post go-live support (ALIGNS)
  - Extended support included in implementation contract
  - 30 days of intensive support addressing post-go-live issues
  - Transitions to normal support or Suite Care program after 30 days

### 8.2 Current State Process

**PROCESS**: Anticipated Go-Live Transition  
**TRIGGER**: Implementation complete, system ready for production use  
**STEPS**:
1. Team stops using legacy Core system
2. Team starts using NetSuite for all transactions
3. Potential disruption to in-flight projects and transactions
4. Learning curve during busy operational period

**PAIN POINTS**: 
- Hard cutover approach risks disrupting active projects
- All teams learn new system simultaneously 
- No fallback if critical issues arise
- Potential for data accuracy issues in unfamiliar system

### 8.3 Orion/NetSuite Solution

Orion/NetSuite go-live is executed using proven soft cutover approach rather than risky hard cutover. The soft cutover strategy—starting new business in NetSuite while completing existing Core projects—dramatically reduces go-live risk while enabling team familiarity with NetSuite in controlled way.

By starting new business (new opportunities, new quotes, new orders) in NetSuite on go-live date, KBM Hoag begins accumulating clean data in the new system immediately. New opportunities are fully managed in NetSuite, building experience and confidence with new workflows. Simultaneously, existing projects continue in Core until completion, allowing teams to focus learning energy on new work rather than re-entering completed transactions into new system.

The typical ~6 month dual-system period reflects industry norms for project completion in furniture dealer business. Most projects complete within 2-4 months; extended projects may take 6 months. By the end of 6 months, most Core projects are complete and naturally migrate to NetSuite environment (or retire with Core system). This natural transition is far less risky than forced wholesale migration.

On-site or Teams channel support during go-live weekend provides immediate issue resolution during critical cutover. Whether deployed on-site in Reno or supporting remotely through Teams channel, support team addresses urgent issues preventing business operation.

30 days of post-go-live support (included in implementation) provides extended assistance during stabilization period. Team members learning new system will have questions; edge cases not discovered in UAT may arise in production; performance tuning may be needed. Having dedicated support for 30 days post-go-live ensures that issues are resolved quickly, team confidence builds, and stabilization is successful.

### 8.4 Future State Process

On go-live date, new business (opportunities, quotes, orders, projects) begins in NetSuite while existing Core projects continue to completion. Team members execute new workflows in NetSuite while still running established workflows in Core for in-progress work. Support team is available on-site or through Teams channel during go-live weekend addressing urgent issues. In the following weeks and months, team members become increasingly familiar with NetSuite workflows, Core usage decreases as projects complete, and organization gradually transitions to NetSuite-only operations. By month 6 post-go-live, most business has transitioned; Core system is retired.

## 9. POST-GO-LIVE SUPPORT & LONG-TERM OPTIMIZATION

### 9.1 Your Business Requirements

- **REQ-044**: Establish Suite Care program for ongoing support and optimization (ALIGNS)
  - Ongoing support beyond 30-day post-go-live period
  - Managed services option providing dedicated support
  - Bank of hours option enabling flexible support access
  - Continuous platform optimization

- **REQ-045**: Enable client self-sufficiency on the platform as long-term goal (ALIGNS)
  - NetSuite Champions enable internal support capability
  - Reduction of consultant dependency over time
  - Team becomes self-sufficient managing day-to-day changes
  - Philosophy: "You don't just go live, you thrive"

### 9.2 Current State Process

**PROCESS**: Legacy System Support (Current State)  
**TRIGGER**: Question or issue arises; change needed  
**STEPS**:
1. User contacts Core vendor support → potential delays, limited availability
2. User implements workarounds → creates inefficiency
3. User documents needs for future → backlog of enhancements

**PAIN POINTS**: 
- Legacy system vendor may have limited support resources
- Internal team has become expert in workarounds rather than solution optimization
- Enhancement backlog grows without structured approach

### 9.3 Orion/NetSuite Solution

Orion/NetSuite provides multiple post-go-live support options reflecting different client needs and maturity levels. For the first 30 days (included in implementation), intensive support helps team stabilize on platform and builds confidence. For longer-term support, KBM Hoag can select from managed services (dedicated support resources on retainer) or bank of hours (flexible support access), selecting based on expected ongoing support needs.

The long-term self-sufficiency goal leverages NetSuite Champions identified and trained during implementation. Rather than creating permanent dependency on external consultants, the Champions program builds internal capability. Internal team members become the primary support layer for colleague questions; consultants support Champions on more complex issues. This approach:
- Reduces long-term support costs
- Empowers internal teams to continuously improve platform
- Creates sustainable support model
- Reduces response time (internal colleagues faster than external consultants)

The "You don't just go live, you thrive" philosophy reflects Orion's commitment to post-implementation success. Implementation is the beginning, not the end. Ongoing optimization, process improvement, and capability enhancement continue post-go-live, with clients increasingly becoming self-sufficient managing those improvements.

### 9.4 Future State Process

For 30 days immediately post-go-live, dedicated support team addresses stabilization issues, team questions, and urgent configuration adjustments. After 30 days, KBM Hoag selects Suite Care program (managed services or bank of hours) for ongoing support. Internal NetSuite Champions handle first-line support for colleague questions. When Champions encounter questions requiring expert consultation, they engage Suite Care support. Over time, team capability grows, support needs decrease, and organization becomes increasingly self-sufficient managing platform optimization and changes.

## 10. TRANSACTION MANAGEMENT & PROJECT NUMBERING

### 10.1 Your Business Requirements

- **REQ-046**: Establish consistent project number/naming across Opportunity → Proposal → Sales Order → PO (ALIGNS)
  - Project number remains consistent throughout transaction lifecycle
  - Different transaction types have separate numbering sequences (Opportunity #, Quote #, SO #, PO #)
  - Project number ties all transactions together
  - Enables tracing transaction history for any project

- **REQ-047**: Enable global search by project, customer name, phone number (ALIGNS)
  - Quick access to any project or customer record
  - Multiple search criteria enabling users to find information efficiently
  - Reduces time spent searching for information

- **REQ-048**: Configure recent transaction dialog for quick access to last 10-15 items (ALIGNS)
  - Frequently accessed transactions available in recent items dialog
  - Quick access without search when recent item is needed
  - Improves workflow efficiency

### 10.2 Current State Process

**PROCESS**: Transaction Access (Current State)  
**TRIGGER**: User needs to access previous order or project  
**STEPS**:
1. User recalls order/transaction number from memory → searches in Core
2. User accesses transaction directly if number recalled → quick if memorized
3. User struggles with search if number not recalled → frustration if unsuccessful

**PAIN POINTS**: 
- Memorized transaction numbers won't work the same way in NetSuite
- NetSuite transaction numbering different from Core (Opportunity, Quote, SO, PO each have separate sequences)
- User adjustment required to new navigation and search methods
- "Kleenex may be required" adjustment period

### 10.3 Orion/NetSuite Solution

Orion/NetSuite provides consistent project numbering across transaction lifecycle—project number visible and usable throughout Opportunity → Quote → Sales Order → Purchase Order → Project flow. While each transaction type has its own sequential numbering (Opportunity-####, Quote-####, SO-####, PO-####), the project number ties them all together, enabling users to trace all transactions related to a specific project.

Global search capability across project number, customer name, and phone number enables users to find transactions without memorizing specific transaction numbers. This is more intuitive and less error-prone than trying to remember order numbers. The search by phone number is particularly useful for order entry staff receiving calls from customers—they can quickly locate customer record by phone without needing customer number.

Recent transaction dialog (last 10-15 items) provides frequently accessed transactions without requiring search. This small usability feature significantly improves workflow for data entry staff repeatedly accessing same transactions.

The adjustment from memorized order numbers to search-based navigation is acknowledged as a temporary challenge ("Kleenex may be required"), but is quickly overcome as users become familiar with new approach. The project number consistency provides continuity, helping users understand that while the transaction numbers changed, the project identification remains consistent.

### 10.4 Future State Process

Users will access transactions either through global search (by project, customer, or phone) or through recent transaction dialog if the transaction was recently accessed. Project number will be visible on all related transactions (opportunity, quote, sales order, PO), enabling users to understand relationship between transactions even with different transaction numbers. Over time, users become familiar with new search approach and transaction numbering, making it natural and efficient.
