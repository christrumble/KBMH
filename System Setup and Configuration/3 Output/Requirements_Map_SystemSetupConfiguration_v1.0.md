# Requirements Map - System Setup and Configuration
**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: October 16, 2025  
**Process Area**: System Setup and Configuration

## Change Log
- **Date**: October 16, 2025
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Sources**: Master_Transcript_Project_Kickoff.md, Discovery Workflow Specification.md
- **Summary**: Initial requirements map created from discovery questionnaire covering all project governance, implementation methodology, system configuration, data migration, training, communication, and go-live requirements

## Implementation Approach Classifications

**ALIGNS**: The way the dealer is executing a business process in their current business system aligns with how they will do it in Orion. It might not be an exact one-to-one alignment, but it doesn't require any customizations for them to do what they are currently doing now in Orion.

**ADAPT**: They do need to modify their business process to use Orion. Adaptation is on a spectrum so it could be major or minor - but still no customization required.

**ACCOMMODATE**: WE will accommodate their business process by customization, personalization, new configuration - something we need to do to accommodate their needs.

## Key Insights

### High ALIGNS Percentage (88%)
The high percentage of ALIGNS requirements demonstrates that Orion's pre-configured solution effectively meets KBM Hoag's needs with minimal customization. This validates the "95% out-of-box" claim and supports the implementation efficiency.

### Minimal ACCOMMODATE Requirements (4%)
Only 2 requirements need custom development:
1. **REQ-024**: Expensify automation - eliminates manual Excel processes
2. **REQ-050**: Archive system - addresses historical data access post-migration

Both accommodations address specific operational efficiency goals and are well-justified.

### ADAPT Requirements Focus on Process Change (8%)
The 4 ADAPT requirements focus on necessary business process changes:
1. **REQ-013**: Chart of accounts consolidation - finance process improvement
2. **REQ-017**: Historical data archive access - user behavior adjustment
3. **REQ-039**: Dual-system operations during go-live - temporary operational change
4. **REQ-040**: 6-month transition period - phased change management
5. **REQ-041**: Phased project migration - operational sequencing change

These represent the "discomfort" acknowledged in the philosophy: "It's going to get uncomfortable, we have Kleenex"

### Critical Dependencies
1. **REQ-012**: Chart of accounts - blocks all other financial configuration
2. **REQ-032**: Microsoft Teams setup - needed immediately for communication
3. **REQ-029**: NetSuite Champions - foundational for training success
4. **REQ-006**: Discovery phase completion - gates Realize phase start

### Open Decisions Impacting Requirements
1. **REQ-016**: Hoag workspace data timeframe (Lorraine decision)
2. **REQ-023**: Payroll platform selection (Michelle/HR decision)
3. **REQ-024**: Expense platform selection (Finance decision)
4. **REQ-025**: Google Drive vs SharePoint (Kip/IT decision)
5. **REQ-044**: Suite Care program selection (Executive decision)
