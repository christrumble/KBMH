# Discovery Session Questions and Priorities - KBMH Project

## Executive Summary

Based on analysis of the Discovery Master Outline and existing transcript coverage, this document identifies the specific questions we need to ask in follow-up discovery sessions. We have excellent coverage for Marketing, CRM, and Financial Management, but need focused sessions for 5 remaining areas.

## Transcript Coverage Status
