## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Overall Completeness
**92% of questions fully answered** - The CRM discovery questionnaire is comprehensive and well-documented with strong evidence backing. Of 50 requirements identified, 47 have complete information with clear implementation approaches. Only 3 requirements need minor clarification details, and 10 configuration taxonomies need finalization via action items (not requiring additional discovery sessions).

### Critical Gaps
**No critical gaps identified.** All must-have requirements (REQ-001 through REQ-048) have sufficient detail for implementation planning. The remaining gaps are **configuration details** (dropdown values, taxonomies, thresholds) that can be finalized through documented action items with specific stakeholders.

### Follow-up Sessions Needed
**Zero (0) full discovery sessions required.** All business process questions have been answered. The 10 outstanding action items can be completed through:
- Document reviews (approval flowchart from Shannon)
- Working sessions with stakeholders to finalize taxonomies (30-60 minutes each)
- Excel template review (Sales Goals dashboard design)

### Estimated Timeline
**2-3 weeks to achieve 100% completion** through action item execution:
- Week 1: Shannon documents approval flowchart; Matt/Kip provide Sales Goals template
- Weeks 1-2: Working sessions to finalize taxonomies (opportunity stages, contact roles, sectors, lead sources, win/loss codes)
- Week 2: Identify data quality owner
- Week 3: Final documentation review and sign-off

## 11. RISK ASSESSMENT

### Risks Identified in Gap Analysis

**Risk 1: Taxonomy Working Session Delays**
- **Description**: If Working Session 1 is delayed, configuration phase will be impacted
- **Likelihood**: Low (straightforward 90-minute session)
- **Impact**: Medium (delays configuration by duration of delay)
- **Mitigation**: Schedule immediately; can split into multiple shorter sessions if scheduling is difficult

**Risk 2: Shannon Approval Flowchart Not Completed**
- **Description**: Shannon may be too busy to create flowchart in time
- **Likelihood**: Low-Medium (dependent on Shannon's availability)
- **Impact**: Medium (delays approval workflow configuration)
- **Mitigation**: Offer consultant support to create draft flowchart based on documented rules; Shannon validates

**Risk 3: Sales Goals Excel Template Not Available**
- **Description**: Current template may not exist in documented form or may be ad-hoc
- **Likelihood**: Low (team references tracking in Excel regularly)
- **Impact**: Low (can design dashboard based on general requirements if template unavailable)
- **Mitigation**: Interview Matt/Kip about metrics and layout if template not available

**Risk 4: Sales Team Pushback on Required Fields**
- **Description**: Team may resist validation rules and required fields during implementation
- **Likelihood**: Medium-High (noted as expected resistance: "Sales will be our biggest pushback")
- **Impact**: High (could undermine CRM adoption and data quality goals)
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Matt's executive sponsorship critical
  - Show value fast (pipeline visibility, forecast accuracy)
  - Balance requirements with ease of entry
  - Phased approach: Start with minimal required fields, add more as team adapts

**Risk 5: Data Quality Owner Not Identified**
- **Description**: No clear owner may result in data quality degrading over time
- **Likelihood**: Low (decision can be made by Matt)
- **Impact**: High (long-term system success depends on data quality)
- **Mitigation**: Recommend creating clear role (Sales Operations or CRM Admin); include in job descriptions; provide training

## 12. SUMMARY & RECOMMENDATIONS

### Key Findings

1. **Discovery is Substantially Complete**: 92% of questions fully answered with strong evidence. No additional full discovery sessions required.

2. **Remaining Work is Configuration Details**: 10 action items for finalizing taxonomies, flowcharts, and templates - not new requirements discovery.

3. **3 Efficient Working Sessions**: All remaining gaps can be closed through three focused working sessions (total 2.75 hours) plus document requests.

4. **Strong Stakeholder Engagement**: All key roles participated in discovery with good representation and clear quotes.

5. **Change Management is Critical**: Noted resistance from sales team expected; executive sponsorship and showing value fast will be key to adoption.

6. **No Show-Stoppers**: No critical gaps preventing progress to BRD development and configuration phase.

### Recommendations

**Recommendation 1: Prioritize Working Session 1**
Schedule the Sales Pipeline Configuration Workshop immediately (Week 1). This single 90-minute session closes 7 of the 10 action items and resolves the 2 highest-priority gaps.

**Recommendation 2: Support Shannon with Flowchart**
Offer to create draft approval flowchart based on documented rules (REQ-021, REQ-022, REQ-023, REQ-024) for Shannon to validate rather than creating from scratch. Reduces her burden and ensures accuracy.

**Recommendation 3: Start Configuration in Parallel**
While finalizing taxonomies, begin NetSuite configuration for requirements that are 100% complete (REQ-001 through REQ-009, REQ-014, REQ-015, REQ-031, REQ-032, REQ-033-037, REQ-038-048). Don't wait for all details before starting.

**Recommendation 4: Plan Change Management Early**
Given expected sales team resistance, develop change management strategy now:
- Identify quick wins to demonstrate value
- Plan role-specific training
- Prepare executive sponsorship messaging for Matt
- Create recognition program for data quality

**Recommendation 5: Establish Data Quality Owner Now**
Don't defer data quality owner decision. Make this a Week 1 priority - success of entire CRM implementation depends on ongoing data stewardship.

**Recommendation 6: Territory Overlap Can Wait**
Q-Organic-3 (territory overlap handling) is not critical for Phase 1. Document as "post-go-live policy" and address when first real scenario arises. Don't delay implementation for an edge case.
