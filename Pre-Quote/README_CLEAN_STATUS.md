# KBMH Pre-Quote Folder - CLEAN STATUS
**Date:** November 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COR CONTAMINATION REMOVED

---

## What Was Done

### ✅ DELETED
- `Master_Transcript_Pre-Quote.md` - **COR (Creative Office Resources) source**
  - This was incorrectly placed in KBMH folder
  - Source was Pre-Quote Transcript.txt (COR) not KBMH
  - Removed to prevent contamination

### ⚠️ ARCHIVED (Consider Removing)
These files are COR-derived and should not be used:
- `3 Output/Questionnaire_PreQuote_v1.0.md` - Generated from COR source
- `3 Output/Requirements_Map_PreQuote_v1.0.md` - Generated from COR source
- `3 Output/GapAnalysis_PreQuote.md` - Generated from COR source

### ✅ KEEP - Clean KBMH Discovery Guide
- `3 Output/PreQuote_Follow-Up_Discovery_Session_REFINED.md` v3.0
  - Zero COR references
  - Open-ended discovery questions for KBMH
  - Ready to send to KBMH stakeholders

## Next Steps

### For KBMH Pre-Quote Implementation:

1. **Schedule KBMH Pre-Quote Discovery Sessions**
   - Use: `PreQuote_Follow-Up_Discovery_Session_REFINED.md` v3.0
   - This document has all questions ready
   - No COR assumptions - pure discovery questions

2. **Conduct Discovery with KBMH Stakeholders**
   - Quoting team members
   - Operations manager
   - Sales representatives
   - Finance/accounting (if needed)

3. **Capture KBMH Input**
   - Record/transcript the discovery sessions
   - Save as: `2 Input/Master_Transcript_Pre-Quote_KBMH.md` (when KBMH data is available)

4. **Generate KBMH Requirements**
   - After discovery: Generate fresh questionnaire from KBMH source
   - Generate fresh requirements map from KBMH source
   - Generate fresh gap analysis from KBMH source
