is going to be too tough.","startTime":"05:22","endTime":"05:24","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"It's more of just kind of nailing down a few things, closing some gaps, making some decisions here.","startTime":"05:24","endTime":"05:30","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So the first one is what we just want to nail down, make sure we have it correct in our BRD is the request types specifically for labor quotes.","startTime":"05:30","endTime":"05:38","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I think we had mentioned or reviewed that there were four labor quote request types.","startTime":"05:38","endTime":"05:43","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Internal, external, intermarket, and a fourth one, lts.","startTime":"05:43","endTime":"05:50","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And I can't remember what that stands for, but if we can, we don't.","startTime":"05:50","endTime":"05:55","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Have internal, so I don't know where that came through on the

system.","startTime":"06:00","endTime":"06:03","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So we, everything goes outside.","startTime":"06:04","endTime":"06:06","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"So we have third party.","startTime":"06:06","endTime":"06:10","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"And then.","startTime":"06:11","endTime":"06:11","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I don't, I mean we don't really.","startTime":"06:13","endTime":"06:15","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Even if it's intermarket, it's GSI third party.","startTime":"06:17","endTime":"06:19","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"So no need to differentiate between intermarket.","startTime":"06:20","endTime":"06:23","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And we usually select intermarket when we select order type.","startTime":"06:23","endTime":"06:29","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Yep.","startTime":"06:29","endTime":"06:30","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"06:30","endTime":"06:30","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Well that makes it really simple.","startTime":"06:33","endTime":"06:34","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So we can inactivate internal, we can change the text from external to third party, we can inactivate intermarket and then some.","startTime":"06:35","endTime":"06:45","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I'm sorry, somebody remind me what GSI is?","startTime":"06:45","endTime":"06:47","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"No idea.","startTime":"06:48","endTime":"06:49","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"It must be some artifact from one of the conversations.","startTime":"06:50","endTime":"06:54","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"06:55","endTime":"06:56","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then anything.","startTime":"06:59","endTime":"07:02","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So nothing to differentiate between external and intermarket.","startTime":"07:02","endTime":"07:05","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So that's fine.","startTime":"07:05","endTime":"07:06","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So we'll make sure in the BRD we talk about exactly what we'll do.","startTime":"07:06","endTime":"07:09","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"By the way, when we make some of these notate some of these things in the brd that kind of becomes our blueprint for when we get into the configuration phase, which is realize.","startTime":"07:10","endTime":"07:19","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So we take the information from BRD and that's.","startTime":"07:19","endTime":"07:21","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"We make sure we configure things properly.","startTime":"07:21","endTime":"07:23","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So as I mentioned, for the sake of the transcript and activate internal and intermarket, rename external to third party.","startTime":"07:23","endTime":"07:30","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"GSI is not.","startTime":"07:30","endTime":"07:32","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"That's an artifact or something that doesn't mean anything.","startTime":"07:32","endTime":"07:34","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And then the process currently, as you have it, if you can just walk us through the initiation of the process, who initiates it, how you're sending them out.","startTime":"07:37","endTime":"07:47","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I'm kind of thinking like do you send it out to multiple vendors for bid or do you primarily just have one?","startTime":"07:48","endTime":"07:55","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"What's the typical path there?","startTime":"07:56","endTime":"07:58","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Generally what we'll do is either the PM or the account manager will send out the labor request, and sometimes we do send it to multiple installation partners, and that information is sent out via email with attachments and.","startTime":"07:58","endTime":"08:19","speaker_name":"Wendy Stark","speaker_id":8},{"sentence":"Or links, just depending on how large those links are.","startTime":"08:19","endTime":"08:22","speaker_name":"Wendy Stark","speaker_id":8},{"sentence":"And so obviously that email has a description of, you know, the requests for the scope of work and all of that information.","startTime":"08:22","endTime":"08:31","speaker_name":"Wendy Stark","speaker_id":8},{"sentence":"So that.","startTime":"08:32","endTime":"08:33","speaker_name":"Wendy Stark","speaker_id":8},{"sentence":"Yeah, and again, when we're in a.","startTime":"08:33","endTime":"08:34","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Bid situation, we would obviously send it out to multiples.","startTime":"08:34","endTime":"08:37","speaker_name":"Wendy Stark","speaker_id":8},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"08:37","endTime":"08:38","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"08:39","endTime":"08:39","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So you don't have a centralized process.","startTime":"08:39","endTime":"08:40","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"It's not one person sending this out.","startTime":"08:40","endTime":"08:42","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"It's multiple people who could be sending this out.","startTime":"08:42","endTime":"08:44","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Yeah, that's correct.","startTime":"08:44","endTime":"08:46","speaker_name":"Wendy Stark","speaker_id":8},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"08:47","endTime":"08:47","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"We have a form that we basically have them fill out.","startTime":"08:47","endTime":"08:51","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"It's an email template.","startTime":"08:51","endTime":"08:52","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"If we could move that template into Orion and then Orion issue that email, that would be great.","startTime":"08:52","endTime":"08:58","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Absolutely.","startTime":"09:00","endTime":"09:00","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think that form is going to be part of the labor quote request.","startTime":"09:00","endTime":"09:04","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Form inside of Orion.","startTime":"09:04","endTime":"09:05","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So if we can get a copy of that, you might have already sent it.","startTime":"09:06","endTime":"09:08","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I don't want to ask for it again if you already sent it.","startTime":"09:08","endTime":"09:10","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Chris, maybe you can just mention the chat if you already got that or not.","startTime":"09:12","endTime":"09:16","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I'm not sure if I should be asking for that on your behalf, but.","startTime":"09:16","endTime":"09:19","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Just let us know if they.","startTime":"09:20","endTime":"09:21","speaker_name":"Marcus

standard.","startTime":"09:25","endTime":"09:27","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"We can see if it works or if we need to change anything.","startTime":"09:27","endTime":"09:31","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Yep, we can do that.","startTime":"09:34","endTime":"09:35","speaker_name":"Marcus

make.","startTime":"09:38","endTime":"09:39","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So an action item for us is to take a screenshot of our labor quote request form and send that off to them so they can compare it against their form.","startTime":"09:39","endTime":"09:46","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"We'll trade forms and we'll

of.","startTime":"10:06","endTime":"10:07","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Yeah, let's go back to the calculation of labor.","startTime":"10:08","endTime":"10:11","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So you probably send it out for a bid or you get your vendor's quote back and then you're

their quote number on the line and we issue a PO against that line, and our PO references their quote number, and that's our acceptance of their

Orion.","startTime":"13:57","endTime":"14:10","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So we have a process in Orion where you can accept a specific labor quote and then you can

typically.","startTime":"14:34","endTime":"14:35","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Oftentimes it's one labor line, but sometimes we itemize it depending on the scope of the work.","startTime":"14:36","endTime":"14:41","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"So if it's multi phase or we've asked for like four trip charges, but we're only going to issue a PO for one trip charge and hold back the three.","startTime":"14:41","endTime":"14:50","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"So there's a lot of different stuff.","startTime":"14:50","endTime":"14:52","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Kimmy can speak in more depth about kind of the ways that AMs play around with that.","startTime":"14:52","endTime":"14:57","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"You said it pretty well.","startTime":"15:00","endTime":"15:01","speaker_name":"Kimi

released.","startTime":"15:01","endTime":"15:12","speaker_name":"Kimi Katsuyoshi","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So we will add lines that are part of a grouped labor cell line and only issue the PoS

Katsuyoshi","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"15:27","endTime":"15:28","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we might ask them to over quote, but then we'll under issue the po hoping that we don't have to use the difference.","startTime":"15:29","endTime":"15:36","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"And if we do have to use the difference, it's in there.","startTime":"15:36","endTime":"15:38","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"And then we'll issue the PO as it's requested.","startTime":"15:38","endTime":"15:40","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"But.","startTime":"15:40","endTime":"15:40","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Yeah, but we're hoping.","startTime":"15:42","endTime":"15:45","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"To hold on to that money.","startTime":"15:45","endTime":"15:46","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"We GSI build a client, right.","startTime":"15:46","endTime":"15:49","speaker_name":"Marcus

sure, yeah.","startTime":"15:52","endTime":"15:54","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Got it.","startTime":"15:54","endTime":"15:54","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And then going back, I do like.","startTime":"15:56","endTime":"15:59","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"The idea of being able to though.","startTime":"15:59","endTime":"16:00","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Like if a labor quote comes in, if we send out a labor quote request, it comes back in and then we can.","startTime":"16:00","endTime":"16:05","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Where we spend a lot of time is copying and pasting.","startTime":"16:06","endTime":"16:08","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"So like the less copy and pasting we can do to get it to what it needs to be.","startTime":"16:08","endTime":"16:12","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"You know, there's a method that Orion has built in to do that, then we definitely want to look at what that process change could be.","startTime":"16:13","endTime":"16:22","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Yep.","startTime":"16:22","endTime":"16:23","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, definitely.","startTime":"16:23","endTime":"16:24","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"There's a labor quote acceptance feature

itemized.","startTime":"16:24","endTime":"16:38","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And you can kind of.","startTime":"16:38","endTime":"16:39","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You can kind of fiddle with that a little bit.","startTime":"16:39","endTime":"16:41","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And then it connects the quote and the labor quote together and it makes labor quote part of the project.","startTime":"16:41","endTime":"16:46","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So when we're doing all our project reporting later on, you have visibility starting at the labor quote, to the quote, to the sales order, to the invoice.","startTime":"16:46","endTime":"16:56","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And you know exactly yet you see all those costs and even purchase orders and bills.","startTime":"16:56","endTime":"17:01","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So you can have that visibility.","startTime":"17:02","endTime":"17:04","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And I'm thinking also, since you are, it's decentralized as far as who can send this out for quote.","startTime":"17:06","endTime":"17:11","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I imagine as far as accepting it is also decentralized.","startTime":"17:11","endTime":"17:15","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"There's not any specific person that could do the acceptance.","startTime":"17:15","endTime":"17:18","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"It's really whoever's managing that.","startTime":"17:18","endTime":"17:20","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I'm assuming there's not like a rubber stamp by any means.","startTime":"17:20","endTime":"17:25","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Usually it's the account manager or the salesperson that's going to accept the final labor number or the PM if they get some help.","startTime":"17:25","endTime":"17:34","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Marcus, last month I requested like 50 labor quotes.","startTime":"17:34","endTime":"17:37","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"So it's like anybody is available.","startTime":"17:37","endTime":"17:38","speaker_name":"Matt

Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"So they might go get three quotes and then they make a recommendation.","startTime":"17:48","endTime":"17:51","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"But ultimately it's the sales side that makes the final decision on what labor we're going to use.","startTime":"17:52","endTime":"17:57","speaker_name":"Matt

dealers.","startTime":"18:02","endTime":"18:03","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"It's a bit more centralized with some other

questions.","startTime":"18:07","endTime":"18:09","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I just want to make sure that our team has a clear understanding on how you guys are working.","startTime":"18:09","endTime":"18:13","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And I could see the benefit of multiple people being able to do this because it's not bottlenecked through one person or two people.","startTime":"18:13","endTime":"18:20","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Yeah, well, we have so many different markets and

labor quote and tying it to the order.","startTime":"18:37","endTime":"18:42","speaker_name":"Kimi Katsuyoshi","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Like, wouldn't.","startTime":"18:43","endTime":"18:44","speaker_name":"Kimi Katsuyoshi","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"It does it like live freely without association to quote until you tie

right.","startTime":"19:41","endTime":"19:41","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":6},{"sentence":"In one of our conversations, we

note here to confirm that we're all on the same page with that.","startTime":"19:54","endTime":"19:57","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"We have some fields that we would put on there.","startTime":"19:57","endTime":"19:59","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"But does that sound right?","startTime":"19:59","endTime":"20:01","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Having a labor quote dashboard so you can see everything that's been quoted.","startTime":"20:01","endTime":"20:04","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"To be able to see who's with what and what status they are at and what's getting sent out

Dallacqua","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We look at right now who we're doing labor with.","startTime":"20:14","endTime":"20:17","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"It would be

put.","startTime":"20:33","endTime":"20:34","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"We'll put some filters on there.","startTime":"20:34","endTime":"20:35","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So you could filter it to a specific location or a specific division or even a specific

could.","startTime":"21:00","endTime":"21:01","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"That could even be like an end of the month cleanup.","startTime":"21:01","endTime":"21:03","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Well, I guess my question is if, like we.","startTime":"21:04","endTime":"21:06","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"If there's three labor quotes.","startTime":"21:06","endTime":"21:07","speaker_name":"Matt

Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"But something to just think about is.","startTime":"21:11","endTime":"21:12","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Like, okay, we initially went out, got.","startTime":"21:12","endTime":"21:16","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Three labor quotes for a project, we accept one, but then we have to go out and get labor quotes again because their scope change.","startTime":"21:16","endTime":"21:24","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"So we might have to accept another one.","startTime":"21:25","endTime":"21:28","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"So there might be more than one labor quote on A project.","startTime":"21:30","endTime":"21:33","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"It's one thing to think about.","startTime":"21:33","endTime":"21:34","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Ideally, though, if you like, I sent out three and I picked one.","startTime":"21:35","endTime":"21:40","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"The other two would just be rejected.","startTime":"21:40","endTime":"21:41","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"It would close those out because I picked one.","startTime":"21:42","endTime":"21:44","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"But I don't know how they're tied together or if they are tied together in any way.","startTime":"21:44","endTime":"21:47","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"So.","startTime":"21:48","endTime":"21:48","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Yeah, there might be a way.","startTime":"21:50","endTime":"21:51","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"There might be a way that we could.","startTime":"21:51","endTime":"21:53","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"We could think through that.","startTime":"21:53","endTime":"21:54","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So an action item for us is to think through the potential automatic rejection of subsequent labor quotes.","startTime":"21:54","endTime":"22:01","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"If one is a.","startTime":"22:01","endTime":"22:01","speaker_name":"Marcus

accepted.","startTime":"22:02","endTime":"22:03","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Might just want to think through that and think about what the potential exceptions could be.","startTime":"22:04","endTime":"22:09","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"But that could be a simple.","startTime":"22:10","endTime":"22:11","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"For a particular scope.","startTime":"22:11","endTime":"22:12","speaker_name":"Kimi Katsuyoshi","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"22:12","endTime":"22:13","speaker_name":"Kimi Katsuyoshi","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"It can't be for the whole project because you.","startTime":"22:13","endTime":"22:15","speaker_name":"Kimi Katsuyoshi","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Yeah, yeah.","startTime":"22:15","endTime":"22:17","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"For a particular scope.","startTime":"22:17","endTime":"22:19","speaker_name":"Kimi Katsuyoshi","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"I was going to ask what about revisions to that initial labor quote?","startTime":"22:19","endTime":"22:25","speaker_name":"Wendy Stark","speaker_id":8},{"sentence":"Like, let's say it's accepted and we, you know, something changes.","startTime":"22:25","endTime":"22:28","speaker_name":"Wendy Stark","speaker_id":8},{"sentence":"How would.","startTime":"22:29","endTime":"22:30","speaker_name":"Wendy Stark","speaker_id":8},{"sentence":"How does that work in the system?","startTime":"22:30","endTime":"22:32","speaker_name":"Wendy Stark","speaker_id":8},{"sentence":"Because a lot of times we'll just get a revision to the original quote, not necessarily a secondary quote.","startTime":"22:32","endTime":"22:38","speaker_name":"Wendy Stark","speaker_id":8},{"sentence":"It just kind of.","startTime":"22:38","endTime":"22:39","speaker_name":"Wendy Stark","speaker_id":8},{"sentence":"And that will depend on each project.","startTime":"22:39","endTime":"22:42","speaker_name":"Wendy Stark","speaker_id":8},{"sentence":"So we could have multiple quotes or revisions.","startTime":"22:42","endTime":"22:47","speaker_name":"Wendy Stark","speaker_id":8},{"sentence":"Yeah, so the revisions are fine.","startTime":"22:47","endTime":"22:49","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"You can make.","startTime":"22:49","endTime":"22:50","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"You can make edits and send it back out for quoting and then.","startTime":"22:50","endTime":"22:54","speaker_name":"Marcus

it.","startTime":"22:55","endTime":"22:55","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"What I'll need to validate on my end

Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So an action item for me or for our team is to validate with Joe is the acceptance of multiple labor quotes.","startTime":"23:01","endTime":"23:08","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And what does that look like in the system?","startTime":"23:09","endTime":"23:10","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So I just.","startTime":"23:10","endTime":"23:11","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"That's something we need to revisit.","startTime":"23:11","endTime":"23:12","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Okay, well, the other thing is, like.","startTime":"23:13","endTime":"23:15","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We don't have any of this stuff now, so do we need it?","startTime":"23:16","endTime":"23:20","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Are we over.","startTime":"23:20","endTime":"23:21","speaker_name":"Matt

just.","startTime":"23:25","endTime":"23:26","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Yeah, I might want to.","startTime":"23:27","endTime":"23:28","speaker_name":"Marcus

we've.","startTime":"23:29","endTime":"23:30","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"We have, you know, made.","startTime":"23:30","endTime":"23:31","speaker_name":"Marcus

Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And you guys are already thinking about, like, hey, here's a.","startTime":"23:36","endTime":"23:38","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Here's a way that would make it improved.","startTime":"23:38","endTime":"23:40","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And so I just want to confirm.","startTime":"23:40","endTime":"23:41","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"We might have already done some of this.","startTime":"23:41","endTime":"23:43","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"23:43","endTime":"23:44","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The.","startTime":"23:44","endTime":"23:45","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, we.","startTime":"23:45","endTime":"23:46","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"60% of our business is bid RFPs.","startTime":"23:47","endTime":"23:51","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"So we'll go out and get an RFP labor quote, and then we'll win it.","startTime":"23:51","endTime":"23:55","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"And then, you know, the scope completely changes at that point, because what they bid versus what they actually buy is never actually what happens.","startTime":"23:55","endTime":"24:01","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"So then we got to re Quote the whole thing over again and go get new labor quotes and do it all.","startTime":"24:02","endTime":"24:06","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Everything gets done two or three times before we actually issue a po.","startTime":"24:06","endTime":"24:09","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"So.","startTime":"24:10","endTime":"24:10","speaker_name":"Matt

Dallacqua","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"24:11","endTime":"24:12","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Okay, that's important to know.","startTime":"24:12","endTime":"24:13","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And then do you guys.","startTime":"24:13","endTime":"24:14","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Are you doing any of your own internal estimating at all?","startTime":"24:14","endTime":"24:16","speaker_name":"Marcus

good.","startTime":"24:25","endTime":"24:26","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"If you mean that when we forget to get a label quote for something small and we go, I think that's $300, and then we hope we're right about it.","startTime":"24:28","endTime":"24:35","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Yeah, that happens a lot actually, Marcus.","startTime":"24:35","endTime":"24:37","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"I know.","startTime":"24:38","endTime":"24:38","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I was gonna say, how much do.","startTime":"24:38","endTime":"24:40","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You think it would cost to do this?","startTime":"24:40","endTime":"24:43","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Yeah, yeah, no, I'm typically asking that question to see if you have any expectation of having the ability to have rate tables and things like that in the system for estimating, which is something we don't have yet, but we have on the roadmap.","startTime":"24:43","endTime":"24:56","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Yeah, I mean, when you're there, maybe we'll talk about it.","startTime":"24:57","endTime":"25:00","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Right now we have rate tables that we keep based off of hourly rates.","startTime":"25:00","endTime":"25:03","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"But you know, most of our installers have rate tables that are like, knocks it down by like

tables.","startTime":"25:15","endTime":"25:17","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"We don't, we don't get that deep.","startTime":"25:17","endTime":"25:19","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"25:19","endTime":"25:20","speaker_name":"Marcus

Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"25:39","endTime":"25:40","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then another thing to consider here is since the whole system is integrated so you have this end to end platform, we typically, well, we allow for you to launch a labor quote from an opportunity.","startTime":"25:41","endTime":"25:54","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So this is kind of where the CRM has overlap into the out kind of the operation side of things.","startTime":"25:54","endTime":"26:00","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So from the opportunity you can generate that labor quote or even for that matter, you know, request for design right off the opportunity.","startTime":"26:01","endTime":"26:07","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Then the opportunity gets linked to the quote and everything has a relationship.","startTime":"26:08","endTime":"26:11","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So I just want to make you aware of that.","startTime":"26:11","endTime":"26:12","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I don't know if you're typically doing it.","startTime":"26:12","endTime":"26:14","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Definitely want to do that.","startTime":"26:14","endTime":"26:15","speaker_name":"Matt

Google worksheet.","startTime":"26:23","endTime":"26:27","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Like everything is a Google worksheet that then dumps into a separate.","startTime":"26:27","endTime":"26:30","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"So Kimmy and I did a vlookup segment of seven different Google

opportunity.","startTime":"26:57","endTime":"27:04","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"But you don't need to go to the project record to launch this.","startTime":"27:04","endTime":"27:07","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"The buttons are on the opportunity to.","startTime":"27:07","endTime":"27:09","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Do that or the co or the quote.","startTime":"27:09","endTime":"27:12","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then right now, when you're.","startTime":"27:12","endTime":"27:14","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"When you're.","startTime":"27:15","endTime":"27:16","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So this is kind of where the salesperson is going to kind of be really a part of the system, in the system creating that opportunity and capturing scope and even initiating the labor quote, which it sounds like that they were doing anyway.","startTime":"27:17","endTime":"27:29","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So this, I think, is going to be a really good flow for you.","startTime":"27:29","endTime":"27:31","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Do they typically now kind of capture that initial scope where they typically capture that now?","startTime":"27:32","endTime":"27:39","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I should have asked the question that said it.","startTime":"27:39","endTime":"27:42","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Where are they capturing their initial scope?","startTime":"27:42","endTime":"27:45","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So, Kim, I think it basically might be in the marketing request or the design request is the initial scope.","startTime":"27:46","endTime":"27:52","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Depends.","startTime":"27:52","endTime":"27:52","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"So if it's a bid, that initial scope's going through the marketing request and the design request.","startTime":"27:52","endTime":"27:57","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"If it's a non bid, then that initial scope's getting captured in the design request.","startTime":"27:57","endTime":"28:01","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Got it.","startTime":"28:04","endTime":"28:04","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"It's usually not getting captured in this.","startTime":"28:04","endTime":"28:06","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"In Zendesk, because Zendesk is only capturing project date and timeline and amount.","startTime":"28:06","endTime":"28:14","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"So it's not really happening on the CRM.","startTime":"28:14","endTime":"28:16","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"It could happen like again, it goes.","startTime":"28:16","endTime":"28:19","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Back to how much do you want to copy and paste.","startTime":"28:19","endTime":"28:21","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"So, like, people aren't going to put everything in Zendesk, then put everything in the request and then put everything in Core and so on, because they're just having to copy everything.","startTime":"28:21","endTime":"28:30","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"So I could see it flowing.","startTime":"28:30","endTime":"28:32","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"If that same information just keeps pulling all the way through as you go, you only have to put the address in once because that's the site address and it's going to show up on the quote and so on and so on.","startTime":"28:32","endTime":"28:42","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Yeah, so the scope can get.","startTime":"28:42","endTime":"28:44","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"If we capture the scope at the opportunity, and then that opportunity initiates the marketing request, the design request, the PM requests, the labor request, then great, they're all getting the same scope.","startTime":"28:45","endTime":"28:58","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"We know that they're getting the same information.","startTime":"28:58","endTime":"28:59","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Yeah, yeah, that's exactly how it'll work.","startTime":"29:00","endTime":"29:02","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So you only have to put that information in once.","startTime":"29:02","endTime":"29:04","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Now, the one thing to consider is because it kind of works in that linear fashion, if I'm working on my opportunity and I put in my scope, then that flows to the labor quote, that flows to the design request or whatever.","startTime":"29:04","endTime":"29:16","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"If somebody starts adding scope on any of those other documents, there's no way for that to retroactively update the Opportunity scope field.","startTime":"29:16","endTime":"29:25","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So one thing to consider is where is kind of like the where would be the most important place for that source of truth on scope to be.","startTime":"29:26","endTime":"29:35","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Where should that be captured?","startTime":"29:36","endTime":"29:37","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Now, there are things that we can do to make sure those fields stay in sync that can sometimes get a little tricky.","startTime":"29:38","endTime":"29:44","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"We just have to think about some.","startTime":"29:48","endTime":"29:49","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Of the places that people can mess.","startTime":"29:49","endTime":"29:52","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"It up a little bit.","startTime":"29:52","endTime":"29:53","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So when something goes from an opportunity to a project, does that matter?","startTime":"29:55","endTime":"30:00","speaker_name":"Kimi Katsuyoshi","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Like, do you GSI go back to then the opportunity to revise the scope as the project evolves?","startTime":"30:00","endTime":"30:06","speaker_name":"Kimi Katsuyoshi","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Yeah, because the project, in our system, the project is really almost kind of just a reporting tool.","startTime":"30:07","endTime":"30:11","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"You're not actually even doing much activity on the project except reporting.","startTime":"30:11","endTime":"30:16","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Looking at KPIs, it aggregates all the tasks, all the messages, and everything across all the transactions that are associated with the project.","startTime":"30:16","endTime":"30:25","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"But you're not typically initiating anything from the project.","startTime":"30:25","endTime":"30:28","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"It's kind of like this container and it aggregates all the information there for reporting purposes.","startTime":"30:30","endTime":"30:36","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So I have to remove the definition of opportunity as like pie in the sky.","startTime":"30:38","endTime":"30:45","speaker_name":"Kimi Katsuyoshi","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And it's really more.","startTime":"30:45","endTime":"30:47","speaker_name":"Kimi Katsuyoshi","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"It's an act.","startTime":"30:47","endTime":"30:48","speaker_name":"Kimi Katsuyoshi","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"It could be an active project as well.","startTime":"30:48","endTime":"30:50","speaker_name":"Kimi Katsuyoshi","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Yes.","startTime":"30:51","endTime":"30:51","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Yeah, yeah.","startTime":"30:51","endTime":"30:52","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Like, as soon as you create an opportunity, we automatically create that project record.","startTime":"30:52","endTime":"30:56","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So if you start tracking time against the opportunity or expense reports because you know they're doing sales activities, all that, those costs can start getting aggregated to the project at that point.","startTime":"30:57","endTime":"31:07","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So you will have a lot of these projects that have very little data.","startTime":"31:07","endTime":"31:11","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And that's not really a problem.","startTime":"31:12","endTime":"31:13","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And the idea, the reason why we did that, the idea is we wanted to be able to give you reporting on.","startTime":"31:15","endTime":"31:21","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Here's all the projects you didn't win, and here's all the costs associated with.","startTime":"31:21","endTime":"31:24","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Those projects that you didn't win.","startTime":"31:24","endTime":"31:25","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then you could filter all that by sales rep or.","startTime":"31:26","endTime":"31:30","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I mean, I'm not trying to like.","startTime":"31:31","endTime":"31:33","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Be the bad guy.","startTime":"31:34","endTime":"31:35","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"We look at it now, so it's not okay.","startTime":"31:35","endTime":"31:37","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Yeah, just not as easy to look up.","startTime":"31:37","endTime":"31:40","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"So.","startTime":"31:40","endTime":"31:40","speaker_name":"Lorraine Guzman","speaker_id":6},{"sentence":"So I think for me, if, like, if we're Going to have to relearn then.","startTime":"31:40","endTime":"31:45","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"31:46","endTime":"31:46","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Opportunity is no longer like the opportunity of it just being a lead.","startTime":"31:46","endTime":"31:52","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"It's.","startTime":"31:52","endTime":"31:52","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"The opportunity is where all the information lives.","startTime":"31:52","endTime":"31:55","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"So if the scope changes, we have to go update the opportunity to show that new scope.","startTime":"31:55","endTime":"32:00","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"But therefore, if we update the opportunity.","startTime":"32:00","endTime":"32:02","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"We would need the opportunity to push.","startTime":"32:02","endTime":"32:03","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That update to everything else that's already out there existing.","startTime":"32:03","endTime":"32:06","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"32:09","endTime":"32:09","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So that is something that we can do if we want to.","startTime":"32:09","endTime":"32:11","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"If you want to say the opportunity is kind of the single source of truth for scope, then we can make sure that those records stay in sync.","startTime":"32:11","endTime":"32:19","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"The other reason why I like that idea, Matt, is because, and I think we talked about this before, on the CRM side, you have one opportunity and you could have three quotes tied to that one opportunity because maybe you're giving them good, better, best, or three different options or whatever.","startTime":"32:19","endTime":"32:35","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Or you iterate it or whatever.","startTime":"32:35","endTime":"32:37","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So when you do your pipeline, they.","startTime":"32:37","endTime":"32:38","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Can'T make a decision in time.","startTime":"32:38","endTime":"32:40","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"So we have to split orders.","startTime":"32:40","endTime":"32:41","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Yeah, right.","startTime":"32:41","endTime":"32:43","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"But your pipeline report is.","startTime":"32:44","endTime":"32:46","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Is going to be fed by your opportunity.","startTime":"32:46","endTime":"32:48","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So now the question is, well, what.","startTime":"32:49","endTime":"32:50","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"What's the dollar amount on that opportunity?","startTime":"32:50","endTime":"32:52","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Because that's what's feeding my pipeline.","startTime":"32:52","endTime":"32:53","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I have three quotes out here, and maybe they're 1 million, 2 million, and 3 million.","startTime":"32:53","endTime":"32:57","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So which.","startTime":"32:57","endTime":"32:58","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Which number should feed my pipeline?","startTime":"32:58","endTime":"33:00","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"33:00","endTime":"33:00","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So somebody needs to kind of manage that dollar amount on the opportunity to make sure that the product pipeline report is somewhat accurate.","startTime":"33:00","endTime":"33:06","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So if we're making the opportunity kind of that source of truth for the dollar amount for pipeline and for scope, and maybe there's some other opportunities there, we can train the team just to make sure that, like, hey, here's.","startTime":"33:07","endTime":"33:21","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"In the sales meeting, we look at the opportunity and here are the things that we're updating.","startTime":"33:21","endTime":"33:24","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"We're updating our expected close date or booking date, our dollar amount, because that's feeding our pipeline.","startTime":"33:24","endTime":"33:31","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And.","startTime":"33:31","endTime":"33:31","speaker_name":"Kimi Katsuyoshi","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"And our scope.","startTime":"33:31","endTime":"33:32","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Has our scope changed?","startTime":"33:32","endTime":"33:34","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Has it updated?","startTime":"33:34","endTime":"33:34","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"33:35","endTime":"33:36","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"I guess on that then is like, when do we stop touching the opportunity?","startTime":"33:36","endTime":"33:40","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"So, like, how does the opportunity stop showing up in the pipeline when it goes to.","startTime":"33:40","endTime":"33:44","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Is it when the quote becomes an order?","startTime":"33:45","endTime":"33:46","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Yep.","startTime":"33:47","endTime":"33:47","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"33:48","endTime":"33:48","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because, you know, there's also going to be a point where, like, I don't expect people, you know, if Kimmy goes out to a job, goes to an OAC meeting, and in that OAC meeting, they're like, hey, we want to go from, you know, the mother's room chair.","startTime":"33:48","endTime":"34:02","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"We want this instead of that.","startTime":"34:02","endTime":"34:04","speaker_name":"Matt

Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Like, yeah, so I don't want it to become, you know, this task oriented organization of like, oh, we've got to go back and update the scope and.","startTime":"34:11","endTime":"34:22","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Then like, no, just get it, get shit done.","startTime":"34:22","endTime":"34:25","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's the goal.","startTime":"34:25","endTime":"34:26","speaker_name":"Matt

yeah.","startTime":"34:27","endTime":"34:28","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Don't overdo it.","startTime":"34:28","endTime":"34:29","speaker_name":"Marcus

yeah.","startTime":"34:30","endTime":"34:31","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"There's one other thing you could do too, Matt, and not to give you too many options.","startTime":"34:31","endTime":"34:34","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"You know, natively netsuite.","startTime":"34:35","endTime":"34:36","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"When you take that quote, you convert it to a sales order, it's booked and the opportunity is automatically changed to closed one.","startTime":"34:36","endTime":"34:43","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"The quote is automatically changed to closed one.","startTime":"34:43","endTime":"34:45","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And now you're working with the sales order from that point on.","startTime":"34:45","endTime":"34:48","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"34:49","endTime":"34:49","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"You could lock in the.","startTime":"34:49","endTime":"34:52","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Like if you went to, let's just say you had three quotes and you changed one of those quotes to a status like in negotiation and your probability for that is 95%.","startTime":"34:52","endTime":"35:03","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"You could at that point then say, okay, well we're not considering the other two quotes anymore.","startTime":"35:03","endTime":"35:08","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"This is the only quote that we're considering because it's moved to this particular status.","startTime":"35:08","endTime":"35:11","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So you could have that option as well.","startTime":"35:12","endTime":"35:14","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And then once it hits the status, it automatically updates the amount, the dollar amount on the opportunity.","startTime":"35:14","endTime":"35:20","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So there are, there is some room there for automation if we just carefully think through when precisely that should happen.","startTime":"35:21","endTime":"35:27","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"35:28","endTime":"35:28","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"35:29","endTime":"35:29","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"I mean we don't Normally issue like three

quotes.","startTime":"35:32","endTime":"35:35","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"So if they need a good best, we're going to do that outside the system because it's just faster and easier and it's less clutter in the end.","startTime":"35:35","endTime":"35:43","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Usually it's if we create a quote.","startTime":"35:44","endTime":"35:47","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"What'S going to happen?","startTime":"35:48","endTime":"35:49","speaker_name":"Marcus

I'm.","startTime":"36:08","endTime":"36:10","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So much of what we do happens in Google Slides before we ever even get to a quote because we're getting them to sign off on that Google Slide deck before we start to build out a spec.","startTime":"36:15","endTime":"36:25","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"And then when we build out that spec, we're loading that spec into core and then that's what's issuing our proposal.","startTime":"36:25","endTime":"36:31","speaker_name":"Matt

that.","startTime":"36:57","endTime":"36:59","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"So we might be able to just build it out to say whatever is.","startTime":"36:59","endTime":"37:02","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"You know what we do right now.","startTime":"37:03","endTime":"37:06","speaker_name":"Marcus

there.","startTime":"37:25","endTime":"37:25","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So with.","startTime":"37:26","endTime":"37:26","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"In light of the fact that you, long story short, don't build anything special for it because I think we're fine with just the way it is.","startTime":"37:26","endTime":"37:32","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"37:32","endTime":"37:33","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"37:33","endTime":"37:33","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Well, so my next question was, is there anything, since you're doing so much before the quoting and outside of the system, is there anything that the system, the new system can do to help support any of that?","startTime":"37:33","endTime":"37:44","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Yeah, I think that, well, I mean one you talked about like if we get all those requests into the opportunity and not have to like go open a quote just for those requests and that's super helpful, whatever we can do or create a field or however that works so that we can link that work that they're doing outside the system back to that opportunity so that if I go look at that opportunity and I want to go see what that, where they're at in that process of the Google Docs, I can click a link.","startTime":"37:45","endTime":"38:15","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"I know obviously we're going to have to go and paste that link.","startTime":"38:15","endTime":"38:17","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"It's not like it's going to go auto find it, but I want to be able to just go direct from the opportunity and click a link and it take me to where that work is being done so I can see where it's at in progress.","startTime":"38:17","endTime":"38:27","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"That would be super helpful.","startTime":"38:29","endTime":"38:30","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Kimmy, any other thoughts?","startTime":"38:30","endTime":"38:31","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Well, this is where I imagine and presumably there is that resource management component where as opportunities need to be assigned those different resources, we're able to see what's on a current resources plate to be able to see what would be a good match for the things that aren't yet assigned.","startTime":"38:33","endTime":"38:52","speaker_name":"Kimi Katsuyoshi","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Yeah, yeah, definitely.","startTime":"38:52","endTime":"38:54","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yep.","startTime":"38:54","endTime":"38:55","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Right at the opportunity level you have the order team assignment utility where you can assign resources to the at that point you're assigning it to the opportunity which will eventually become the order.","startTime":"38:55","endTime":"39:05","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"But you're able to do it as early as the opportunity.","startTime":"39:06","endTime":"39:09","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"You could do it at the quote or the sales order, but as early as the opportunity.","startTime":"39:09","endTime":"39:13","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And then you'll have dashboards where you could see everybody and what they're assigned to and counts of how many orders are assigned to or projects are assigned to and things like that.","startTime":"39:14","endTime":"39:23","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Then the other thing I was thinking about that I think is potentially tangentially related, but not directly is I know that there's our Google Drive and that there's our, the SharePoint and then there's the whole NetSuite file cabinet, for lack of a better word.","startTime":"39:25","endTime":"39:41","speaker_name":"Kimi Katsuyoshi","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"39:41","endTime":"39:41","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And I know early on we had talked about how we would definitely have some things in NetSuite, which I imagine basically as our whole order processing folder.","startTime":"39:41","endTime":"39:51","speaker_name":"Kimi Katsuyoshi","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"But when you ask the question about what could we be doing like pre quote that might be helpful?","startTime":"39:52","endTime":"39:57","speaker_name":"Kimi Katsuyoshi","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Like I don't know to what extent the, those presentations, the drawings, the budget specs.","startTime":"39:57","endTime":"40:07","speaker_name":"Kimi Katsuyoshi","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Right now I imagine those things living in drive because they're not directly associated with an actual order, but a pre order.","startTime":"40:08","endTime":"40:15","speaker_name":"Kimi Katsuyoshi","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Like does it, what makes sense, does it all make sense to go into each location so that we're really clear to users about what gets saved where so people can find it when they need it for historical and our matching purposes?","startTime":"40:16","endTime":"40:33","speaker_name":"Kimi Katsuyoshi","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"40:33","endTime":"40:33","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"40:34","endTime":"40:35","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So no, that's a really good point to bring up.","startTime":"40:35","endTime":"40:38","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So SharePoint, the SharePoint integration does allow you to drag and drop files right onto the NetSuite record.","startTime":"40:38","endTime":"40:45","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So let's just say at the opportunity level, or maybe it's at the labor quote or it's at the design request, but you can drag and drop a file right there onto that record in NetSuite and it saves it to SharePoint.","startTime":"40:46","endTime":"40:57","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"But when you're in NetSuite, it looks like it's attached to that record.","startTime":"40:57","endTime":"41:00","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So the user's not in SharePoint.","startTime":"41:01","endTime":"41:04","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"That's where it's backend cloud server.","startTime":"41:04","endTime":"41:07","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"So everything lives in netsuite.","startTime":"41:08","endTime":"41:10","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Yeah, everything lives in netsuite in that sense.","startTime":"41:10","endTime":"41:12","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And there is a folder structure that we have a folder structure paradigm that will work with you on that looks pretty much like how most dealers are doing it in either SharePoint or Drive Now.","startTime":"41:12","endTime":"41:23","speaker_name":"Marcus

like, oh, all the POs have to get exported and put into this.","startTime":"41:51","endTime":"41:59","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Like, I just want everything to live in the system, not the way we're doing it today, so.","startTime":"41:59","endTime":"42:04","speaker_name":"Matt

exactly.","startTime":"42:04","endTime":"42:06","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"42:06","endTime":"42:06","speaker_name":"Matt

go into SharePoint inside of NetSuite, there's a few things that we're GSI working on.","startTime":"42:18","endTime":"42:24","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Like I think like the PDF composer saves to the NetSuite file cabinet.","startTime":"42:25","endTime":"42:28","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Can you use the exact term?","startTime":"42:28","endTime":"42:30","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"It's called file Cabinet netsuite.","startTime":"42:30","endTime":"42:31","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So there's a few things that GSI get saved in NetSuite file cabinet, but we're gonna be moving them to the SharePoint folder as well.","startTime":"42:33","endTime":"42:39","speaker_name":"Marcus

Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"42:41","endTime":"42:41","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The idea though is that everything created inside NetSuite goes into SharePoint and it, but it's accessible right there from NetSuite, so you'll have that.","startTime":"42:41","endTime":"42:50","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Really.","startTime":"42:51","endTime":"42:51","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think the only thing that's going.","startTime":"42:51","endTime":"42:52","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"To live outside that is going to be any docs that end up getting created, most likely the Lookbook and then any CET files.","startTime":"42:52","endTime":"43:01","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"So more of the visual stuff, but less of the what we're seeing right now as far as the.","startTime":"43:02","endTime":"43:08","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"What we're producing in core and exporting and putting into drive.","startTime":"43:09","endTime":"43:12","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Yeah, yeah.","startTime":"43:12","endTime":"43:13","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I will say the way that dealers are doing this is they're using SharePoint inside of NetSuite, but then they're also navigating SharePoint that same folder structure, because that's what they're accustomed to.","startTime":"43:13","endTime":"43:22","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And they are dropping their CT files and everything else in there.","startTime":"43:22","endTime":"43:25","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So you can access that from either the SharePoint user interface or from the NetSuite user interface, so you don't have to have this split.","startTime":"43:25","endTime":"43:34","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And, and you know, netsuite's dropping the files here, but you're putting your other files over here somewhere.","startTime":"43:34","endTime":"43:39","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"It can all be the same place.","startTime":"43:39","endTime":"43:41","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"In my brain though.","startTime":"43:42","endTime":"43:43","speaker_name":"Kimi Katsuyoshi","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"That just sounds like a third place.","startTime":"43:43","endTime":"43:44","speaker_name":"Kimi

Katsuyoshi","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"43:47","endTime":"43:48","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Do you have an on premise server right

Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"43:52","endTime":"43:53","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So everything's cloud based.","startTime":"43:53","endTime":"43:54","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I mean, we do, but they're really just over engineered print servers.","startTime":"43:54","endTime":"43:58","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"That's all they do.","startTime":"43:58","endTime":"43:59","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"43:59","endTime":"44:00","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They allow you to connect the Internet and they allow

good.","startTime":"44:04","endTime":"44:05","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"44:05","endTime":"44:06","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So everything is stored in Google Drive at this point.","startTime":"44:06","endTime":"44:08","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"But one thing that we're facing and we'll talk about is we're running out of room on Google Drive because Google Drive has a very hard limit on not size, but of items.","startTime":"44:08","endTime":"44:19","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"And it counts every folder, accounts, every text document, every copy, it counts everything.","startTime":"44:20","endTime":"44:26","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"And so then we have to keep expanding these drives to archive and so on and so on.","startTime":"44:26","endTime":"44:31","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"So this will reduce the amount of this being pushed there, but we'll decide as an internal team what lives in Drive and then what lives in SharePoint, aka NetSuite.","startTime":"44:31","endTime":"44:40","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Yeah, very good.","startTime":"44:41","endTime":"44:42","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"A couple more questions about requests.","startTime":"44:44","endTime":"44:46","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So design requests.","startTime":"44:46","endTime":"44:47","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Is that the salesperson that's triggering that as well?","startTime":"44:49","endTime":"44:51","speaker_name":"Marcus

Dallacqua","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Great.","startTime":"44:54","endTime":"44:55","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And then how are the designers are assigned?","startTime":"44:56","endTime":"44:58","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Is that like.","startTime":"44:58","endTime":"44:59","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Does the request initially go to a manager?","startTime":"44:59","endTime":"45:01","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Then the manager assigns it.","startTime":"45:01","endTime":"45:02","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Perfect.","startTime":"45:02","endTime":"45:03","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then after that it gets handed off to.","startTime":"45:06","endTime":"45:08","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Oh, yeah.","startTime":"45:11","endTime":"45:11","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"How did.","startTime":"45:11","endTime":"45:12","speaker_name":"Marcus

always.","startTime":"45:30","endTime":"45:31","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, they don't.","startTime":"45:31","endTime":"45:32","speaker_name":"Marcus

simultaneously.","startTime":"45:34","endTime":"45:36","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Sometimes we get, you know, we're putting in a design request and a labor request at the exact same time.","startTime":"45:36","endTime":"45:42","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Okay, yeah.","startTime":"45:42","endTime":"45:43","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"This depends.","startTime":"45:43","endTime":"45:44","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"But again, it'd be nice if in.","startTime":"45:44","endTime":"45:47","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The opportunity, you know, you're putting in scope, you're putting in location, you're putting all that stuff in so that really, when you hit a request, it's just transferring what's already in there to the next person, like.","startTime":"45:47","endTime":"45:57","speaker_name":"Matt

answer.","startTime":"46:03","endTime":"46:04","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"We only had a couple questions on that.","startTime":"46:04","endTime":"46:05","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"What about getting a project manager

around.","startTime":"46:31","endTime":"46:35","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Is it centered around the customer or the

customer?","startTime":"46:39","endTime":"46:42","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Yeah, yeah, it's kind of both, I would say.","startTime":"46:43","endTime":"46:45","speaker_name":"Wendy Stark","speaker_id":8},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"46:45","endTime":"46:45","speaker_name":"Marcus

both?","startTime":"46:51","endTime":"46:53","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"So I have my order team defined on the customer record, and then I also have an order team

they're different.","startTime":"47:05","endTime":"47:07","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So what triggers a team assignment is the account manager.","startTime":"47:08","endTime":"47:11","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"So if, like, if a salesperson puts in a request and then we assign account management, Kimmy

Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"The other thing we have is this concept of default roles, and we call it default roles, but it's more like a required role.","startTime":"52:35","endTime":"52:42","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And we could say in the system for you specifically that an account manager is a required role.","startTime":"52:43","endTime":"52:49","speaker_name":"Marcus Dallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And then what happens is on top of the opportunity or the quote or the order, it has a
