# Requirements Map - Pre-Quote
**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: October 16, 2025  
**Process Area**: Pre-Quote (Labor Quote Requests, Design Requests, Estimating, Project Requests)

## Change Log
- **Date**: October 16, 2025
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Sources**: Master_Transcript_Pre-Quote.md, Discovery Workflow Specification.md
- **Summary**: Initial requirements map created from Pre-Quote discovery questionnaire analysis. Captures 17 requirements across labor quote requests, vendor management, estimating workflows, and project request forms.

## Implementation Approach Classifications

**ALIGNS**: The way the dealer is executing a business process in their current business system aligns with how they will do it in Orion. It might not be an exact one-to-one alignment, but it doesn't require any customizations for them to do what they are currently doing now in Orion.

**ADAPT**: They do need to modify their business process to use Orion. Adaptation is on a spectrum so it could be major or minor - but still no customization required.

**ACCOMMODATE**: WE will accommodate their business process by customization, personalization, new configuration - something we need to do to accommodate their needs.

**FUTURE**: Functionality identified for future development or enhancement phases.

- REQ-012: Job site analysis/site conditions record
- REQ-014: Project request form with checkboxes
- REQ-015: Document attachment support
- REQ-016: RFQ form with branding

### ADAPT (3 Requirements)
Process changes required but no customization:
- REQ-007: Manual calculation entry with notes (process continues, rate tables desired for future)
- REQ-010: Launch requests from Opportunity/Quote (not Project) - **CRITICAL PROCESS CHANGE**
- REQ-011: Capture scope on Labor Quote form (not Project) - **CRITICAL PROCESS CHANGE**

### ACCOMMODATE (7 Requirements)
Customization or configuration required:
- REQ-003: Union status tracking on vendor records
- REQ-004: Vendor location custom field
- REQ-005: Parent-child vendor relationships
- REQ-008: Labor quote acceptance workflow
- REQ-009: Request rejection/send back workflow
- REQ-013: Pending quote dashboard
- REQ-017: Vendor filtering (union, location, intermarket)

## Solution Design Required (7 Requirements)

The following requirements require solution design and technical specifications:
1. **REQ-003**: Union status field - Confirm if exists, define dropdown values
2. **REQ-004**: Location field - Single vs multi-select approach, sourcing from location list
3. **REQ-005**: Parent-child vendors - Structure and relationship configuration
4. **REQ-009**: Rejection workflow - Confirm capability, design send-back mechanism
5. **REQ-013**: Pending quote dashboard - Confirm existing functionality or design saved search
6. **REQ-017**: Vendor filtering - Design filtering interface and logic for multiple criteria

## Critical Dependencies

### Vendor Management Cluster (High Priority)
- REQ-003, REQ-004, REQ-005, REQ-017 are tightly coupled
- Must be designed together to ensure consistent approach
- Required for external labor quote functionality
- **Action**: Technical design session needed with Joe/implementation team

### Request Initiation Process Change (High Priority - Change Management)
- REQ-010 and REQ-011 represent significant process changes
- **Impact**: All users who initiate or process labor quotes
- **Risk**: User resistance, errors during transition
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive training, clear communication of benefits, hands-on practice

### Form Development (Critical Path)
- REQ-001, REQ-007, REQ-011, REQ-014, REQ-016 all require form development
- **Action**: Form development must begin early in configuration phase
- Multiple request type forms needed
- User testing required before go-live

## Missing Requirements (To Be Added)

The following areas were identified as missing documentation and will require additional requirements once documented:

### Design Request Process
- Design request form requirements
- Design assignment workflow
- Design deliverable tracking
- Design-to-quote integration

### PM Request Process
- PM request form requirements
- PM assignment workflow
- PM resource allocation
- PM-to-quote integration

### Long Term Storage Deep Dive
- LTS calculation methodology
- Warehouse rate structures
- Monthly billing workflow
- Storage tracking and reporting

**Estimated Additional Requirements**: 10-15 once documentation is obtained

## Technical Confirmations Needed

Before configuration can proceed, the following technical confirmations are required:

| # | Question | Assigned To | Related REQs | Priority |
|---|----------|-------------|--------------|----------|
| 1 | Does NetSuite currently track union status on vendor records? | Joe | REQ-003 | High |
| 2 | Should vendor location field be multi-select or use parent-child structure? | Joe/Marcus | REQ-004, REQ-005 | High |
| 3 | Does labor quote module include pending status dashboard functionality? | Luke/Chris | REQ-013 | Medium |
| 4 | Does request engine support rejection/send-back workflow? | Joe | REQ-009 | Medium |
| 5 | What dropdown values needed for union/non-union/intermarket classification? | COR Team | REQ-003, REQ-017 | High |
| 6 | What is the CAP/SIF file handling process (PDF vs SIF import)? | COR Team | REQ-015 | Medium |

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
1. **Process Change Adoption** (REQ-010, REQ-011)
   - Risk: Users continue trying to use Project record for request initiation
   - Mitigation: Training, system prompts, clear documentation, champions

2. **Missing Documentation** (Design, PM requests)
   - Risk: Incomplete configuration, rework required
   - Mitigation: Priority sessions scheduled before configuration phase

3. **Vendor Management Complexity** (REQ-003, REQ-004, REQ-005, REQ-017)
   - Risk: Incorrect vendor classification leads to compliance issues
   - Mitigation: Clear dropdown values, data validation, testing

### Medium Risk
1. **Labor Quote Acceptance New Feature** (REQ-008)
   - Risk: Users don't understand benefits, continue manual processes
   - Mitigation: Demonstration of time savings, training on line consolidation benefits

2. **Form Development Timeline** (REQ-001, REQ-007, REQ-011, REQ-014, REQ-016)
   - Risk: Form development delays configuration and testing
   - Mitigation: Early start, prioritize most-used forms, iterative testing

### Low Risk
1. **CAM Reservation Manual Entry** (REQ-006)
   - Risk: Minimal - simple field addition
   - Mitigation: Field validation if needed

2. **Job Site Analysis** (REQ-012)
   - Risk: Minimal - standard functionality
   - Mitigation: User training on where to find/use

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Foundation (Must Complete First)
1. Technical confirmations (union field, location field, request engine capabilities)
2. Vendor management design (REQ-003, REQ-004, REQ-005, REQ-017)
3. Request engine configuration (REQ-002, REQ-009, REQ-010, REQ-014)

### Phase 2: Core Labor Quote Functionality
1. Labor quote request type configuration (REQ-001)
2. Labor quote form development (REQ-006, REQ-007, REQ-011, REQ-015)
3. Labor quote acceptance workflow (REQ-008)
4. Pending quote dashboard (REQ-013)

### Phase 3: Supporting Elements
1. RFQ form design (REQ-016)
2. Job site analysis integration (REQ-012)
3. User training materials

### Phase 4: Missing Process Areas (Post-Documentation)
1. Design request configuration
2. PM request configuration
3. LTS detailed workflow

## Notes and Traceability

### Transcript References
All requirements trace back to Master_Transcript_Pre-Quote.md with direct quotes captured in questionnaire.

Key speakers:
- **Marcus Dallacqua**: Implementation consultant, primary voice for Orion capabilities
- **Chris Trumble**: Implementation team, process questions
- **Gary Strickland**: Consultant, vendor management and process observations

### Questionnaire Cross-Reference
- Section 1: Overview and Current State → REQ-001, REQ-002
- Section 2: Labor Quote Requirements → REQ-003, REQ-004, REQ-005, REQ-007, REQ-008, REQ-013, REQ-017
- Section 3: Project Request Form → REQ-009, REQ-010, REQ-011, REQ-014
- Section 4: Vendor and Document Management → REQ-006, REQ-015, REQ-016
- Section 5: Estimating Process → REQ-012, REQ-014
- Section 7: Process Adaptations → REQ-010, REQ-011 (process change focus)

### Alignment with Orion Philosophy
The ADAPT requirements (REQ-010, REQ-011) reflect Orion's design philosophy:
- Project records serve as reporting/aggregation tools
- Operational data captured on transaction records (Opportunity, Quote)
- Marcus explicitly discussed this approach and recommended adaptation over accommodation

### Future Enhancement Tracking
- **Rate Table Calculations** (related to REQ-007): Multiple dealers requesting this functionality; not currently available in Orion
- **Institutional Knowledge Automation**: Potential to build calculation logic into system once rate tables are developed
