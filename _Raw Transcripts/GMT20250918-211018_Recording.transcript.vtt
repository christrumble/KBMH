WEBVTT

1
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:03.800
Cornerstone: Yes.

2
00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:05.710
Cornerstone: God.

3
00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:09.489
Cornerstone: Have you heard of Michael?

4
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.300
Cornerstone: He was messaging me and didn't respond.

5
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:25.790
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Dude, don't.

6
00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:28.860
Cornerstone: That's being recorded.

7
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:35.950
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So in the beginning.

8
00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:38.760
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Parents…

9
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:40.680
Cornerstone: Yep.

10
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.710
Cornerstone: Oh, one of the guys. Oh, he did? He went, like…

11
00:00:47.169 --> 00:00:49.219
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I get all of a sunscreen, right?

12
00:00:49.222 --> 00:00:50.831
Cornerstone: And then I'll give it to Tusk.

13
00:00:51.668 --> 00:00:55.527
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Team, I'd like to introduce you to the rest of my finance team. I've got Guada.

14
00:00:55.974 --> 00:00:57.664
Cornerstone: He is our AP? Yes.

15
00:00:57.669 --> 00:01:01.828
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): I got Celine and Kevin there on the GL side.

16
00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:19.299
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): And then joining us, we have Michael, who's actually in the Philippines. He's, the AP Dynamic Duo, the second part of our AP team. Right. And then, not sure quite where she is, is when my other AR person, and she's in our San Jose office. So,

17
00:01:19.589 --> 00:01:22.438
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): That makes the mighty finance team.

18
00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:25.538
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Or lean, but my GP.

19
00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:26.909
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Very good.

20
00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:28.619
Cornerstone: And then…

21
00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:36.259
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): The other finance… I know, our other finance partner is Kip, because he has his hands in everything that we do.

22
00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:43.969
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): He's everywhere. He's got the ball trades. The free safety? I'm sorry? A free safety, that's kind of a football…

23
00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.340
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): analogy? I think he used to be a controller here.

24
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:57.519
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): And then he went in and specialized into IT kind of stuff, so… but he still kept a lot of his duties, and we still leverage him for a lot of stuff that he does on board.

25
00:01:57.525 --> 00:01:58.455
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): 15, yeah.

26
00:01:58.455 --> 00:01:59.454
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): He touches everything.

27
00:01:59.455 --> 00:02:00.205
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So…

28
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.620
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Good deal.

29
00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.539
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): What should we start, or should we start? I don't know.

30
00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.229
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): No, we can start, we can start. Okay.

31
00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.359
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Alright, well, welcome. Thanks for joining us,

32
00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:20.540
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): our session, how… how briefed are they on what we're doing? Should I start from… I don't want to start from scratch, you don't have to start from scratch. So you know we're doing a system change? Yep.

33
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.099
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I could not sleep.

34
00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.499
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): That's all I think. Okay.

35
00:02:27.505 --> 00:02:33.084
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So, what we're doing this week is, some discovery sessions, and that is when we

36
00:02:33.195 --> 00:02:47.664
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): kind of give you a little bit of a preview of NetSuite, and then we ask you a whole bunch of questions about how you guys are currently doing your accounting functions. We'll talk a little bit how some of that maps over to NetSuite Orion, and then we're kind of looking to see if you're doing anything that's unique

37
00:02:47.775 --> 00:02:51.144
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): That we don't currently have a… have functionality for.

38
00:02:51.275 --> 00:02:55.885
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And… because we want to plan for it. But the goal for all of this is

39
00:02:56.005 --> 00:03:05.924
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): For us to do kind of a thorough review of everything that you're doing, and, make sure that as you transition from the current system to that transition.

40
00:03:06.115 --> 00:03:08.544
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Go smoothly, and your lives are better.

41
00:03:08.725 --> 00:03:10.254
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): At the end of the day, that's what we want to do.

42
00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:26.159
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Why don't we just spent a lot of time talking about POs. Oh, great. She deals with that. She deals with a lot of the product coordinators, which is Shannon's team. Yeah. Coordinating, all the vendors and vendor invoices and things like that.

43
00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:27.310
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Excellent.

44
00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.419
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Michael, we can't see you.

45
00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.399
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): I have bed head.

46
00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:36.580
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): There we are!

47
00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:38.970
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Very early.

48
00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.280
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Good morning!

49
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.719
Michael Salvador: Yeah, good afternoon.

50
00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.959
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Right. Oh, yes, good afternoon to us. To us, yes, it's excellent.

51
00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.240
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): So anyway, we just spend a lot of time talking about PO systems.

52
00:03:51.510 --> 00:04:03.379
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yeah, so POs and acknowledgements is kind of like the tail end of the process area that we were looking at that we call order management. We're shifting now into financial management, and that contains these

53
00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:13.930
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): topics, and there's a lot. So, company structure and setup, which we've already kind of touched on in the first day. Counting periods and close.

54
00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:19.600
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): currency and exchange rates, so I'm hoping you don't have any. No, we're all in U.S. dollar.

55
00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:20.279
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): bus.

56
00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:26.420
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Tax management, which we've kind of already talked about it. Looks like we're gonna do sweet tax.

57
00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.380
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): We'll talk about journal entries and allocations if necessary.

58
00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:41.979
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Banking and cash management, we've touched on already, credit card management. It's interesting, because, like, finances, like, kind of just weaves through all the other process areas, so by the time we get to financial management, we've kind of talked

59
00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:51.030
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): on a lot of these topics already. So we'll probably be able to just make some decisions and finalize some things. Credit card management, budgeting for planning.

60
00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:55.770
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): period close, customer financial management, Project Accounting.

61
00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:11.799
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): That'll be a good conversation. Revenue and cost recognition is a big one, because it's different inside of NetSuite. Okay. We want to talk through that, and we have a… we have a white paper that we've been working on that we're going to give to you, and we'll review it up on the screen as well. Okay.

62
00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:17.800
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Vendor and account payable management, expense management, which we haven't talked too much about. I do want to…

63
00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:19.070
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Hear from you.

64
00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:24.749
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): About if you want those, like, expense reports, salespeople and things like that to

65
00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.480
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): He tries to the project GP.

66
00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.920
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Awesome, right? Travel reimbursement.

67
00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:38.460
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): We do… we have a… we have two different… Again, our cost structure.

68
00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:52.529
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): our COA, we had to, create a cost to go into cost of goods sold, specifically identified as a project cost, and then we have general G&A-type stuff, so… Gotcha.

69
00:05:53.100 --> 00:06:00.269
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Asset management, which we touched on, fixed asset management is what we're really talking about there, financial security. Your area.

70
00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:05.260
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Financial Reporting and Analytics, which… We have an official…

71
00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:24.800
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): session on business intelligence as well, but I know reporting kind of falls in every process area as well. And the last one's business intelligence reporting. Any topics not covered there? This is not an exhaustive list, just so you know, this is kind of high level. There's a lot to talk about, especially commissions.

72
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.440
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Missions is not on there. But as we're going through, like.

73
00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:32.090
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Like, this is a starting point for us.

74
00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:36.579
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): If there's other topics that come up, we wanna… or you think of things we want to definitely talk about, Paul.

75
00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:43.699
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): One thing we haven't talked about that we mentioned right before we were wrapping up the other one is that we have an internal

76
00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:48.270
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Mock-up margin, 15% that we add to everything.

77
00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:55.600
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Right? Yeah, it's kind of like, word.

78
00:06:55.870 --> 00:07:00.320
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): cushion, it's a contingency line. Basically, what…

79
00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:02.100
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): does currently. There's ruling.

80
00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:04.770
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): That if you enter a labor line that looks.

81
00:07:04.775 --> 00:07:06.045
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): and has them.

82
00:07:06.465 --> 00:07:08.504
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Product code of labor.

83
00:07:08.835 --> 00:07:19.744
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Core then will automatically add lines, 15% of whatever that is. So if I have a $100 labor line, it'll throw in a second line for $15. The reason behind that is

84
00:07:19.885 --> 00:07:26.825
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): It's encouraging people to put bigger margins on labor, because labor is inherently Unpredictable.

85
00:07:27.075 --> 00:07:37.625
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Product, very predictable, you spend in the PO, you get back in development, it's not gonna change. Labor, you're guessing. Until you get in the field and start doing things.

86
00:07:37.655 --> 00:07:49.735
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): So we did that, so it's… there's never really any… it's just the bookkeeping thing. It's just there, and it never, you know, we don't ever cost to prove anything against those lines.

87
00:07:49.735 --> 00:07:50.824
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): external impact.

88
00:07:50.825 --> 00:07:51.975
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): There's no GL impact.

89
00:07:52.585 --> 00:07:59.864
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So, it's just inflating the cost? Correct. Inflating the cost, reducing the margin. Yes.

90
00:08:00.305 --> 00:08:02.854
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So, in effect, it's kind of a…

91
00:08:03.525 --> 00:08:09.385
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): It's kind of a load factor, like we talked about earlier. Yes. Yes. And that's just meant to… that's just meant to cover risk?

92
00:08:09.385 --> 00:08:16.144
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Yeah, and I… that may be up for debate as to whether or not we would want to keep that. I mean, we had… that's a Matt and Mark decision.

93
00:08:16.145 --> 00:08:19.885
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Matt was throwing it out, that we haven't talked about it when he was walking yet, so…

94
00:08:19.885 --> 00:08:23.624
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): be completely in favor of getting rid of it, but I don't… that's not my…

95
00:08:23.625 --> 00:08:26.045
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): We'll… we'll ask them if they… And commission has paid that.

96
00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:27.380
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): After that. Yeah.

97
00:08:27.385 --> 00:08:37.405
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Correct. That's… and that's one of the things with that. It doesn't hint the financials, but it does impact the GP of an order, which affects commission. How… how does other.

98
00:08:37.409 --> 00:08:39.849
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): The dealers deal with this situation?

99
00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:49.989
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yeah, they do this. They do this, and we're not alone. They don't typically do 15%, but they'll do, like, oh, here's 3% load factor, and this covers our design

100
00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:54.920
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): It's designed in PM time. Yeah.

101
00:08:55.400 --> 00:09:02.930
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yep, so different dealers handle that different ways, so we'll just add a line on there, cost-only line. Same thing, it's calculated based on…

102
00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:06.440
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): A percentage of the cost of revenue.

103
00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:14.819
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Oh, and sorry, that 15%, is that off the seller or off the cost? Cost. Oh, yeah, that's why it's higher. So they're typically doing, like, 3% off the revenue.

104
00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:30.789
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So, however you want to calculate that, but it's typical. So, in order to see the true margin of the projects, then we have to run year-to-date data then, right? So, it flats out. So, what we do is, that's why we have two… that's why we have a different set of KPIs. So, we have a set of KPIs for

105
00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:39.819
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): project gross profit, and then we have commissionable gross profit, and then commissionable gross profit includes things like the head factor.

106
00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:45.709
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And then you can determine what people in the organization get to see as far as the KPIs of the project record. Right.

107
00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:51.689
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): I just wanted to make sure we brought it up so you guys knew. Yep.

108
00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:55.820
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So, company structure and setup, we've kind of already talked about this,

109
00:09:56.870 --> 00:10:06.059
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): One subsidiary, we have the other things, the locations, everything, we're good there. Counting periods… do you do 12 counting periods, or do you do 13? I would.

110
00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:11.429
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): like 13. 13.4 only does 12. Okay. So it was, like, 13. Yep.

111
00:10:11.435 --> 00:10:12.935
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): We won't… we shall do 13.

112
00:10:13.135 --> 00:10:14.315
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Calendar year?

113
00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:14.960
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Yes.

114
00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.150
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I love it.

115
00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:21.300
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Mostly, yes.

116
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.150
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): No currency exchange rates, no suite tax.

117
00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:30.909
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yes. Now.

118
00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:34.340
Cornerstone: Yes, sweet tax, for sales tax, correct.

119
00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:36.709
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): What about, what about use tax?

120
00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:43.350
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): So that's our, our current, TaxConnect third party. She takes care of all of that.

121
00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:44.750
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): They're only…

122
00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:52.909
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): We don't have two… two states, I mean, because every state has different, Illinois and Missouri, I think, are the two when we have to file

123
00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:58.450
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Because of the way they define nexus differently, I guess, I don't know. But it's use tax in those states, so…

124
00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:06.420
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): There… yeah, they're the exceptions there, or else it's sales tax. And CORE won't do use tax, so we have to kind of trick it. Okay.

125
00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:10.160
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): There's one more I want to bring up, it's the gross receipts tax.

126
00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:12.389
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Which is, I'm sure we have to generate reports.

127
00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:14.350
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Based on ship 2 location.

128
00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:18.660
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Right? Then we have to do, like, a data dump from core.

129
00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:24.860
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): I don't think I… I'm sure I've seen this report, but I don't remember.

130
00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:26.090
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): You can pull that?

131
00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:27.149
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I've been.

132
00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:37.849
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): But it's… Is it a custom report that we pulled? I can't remember. I run it so infrequently, I'm sure it's on my calendar, but… yeah, I'm…

133
00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:44.780
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): We need the sales… sales revenue number based on ship to location. Is that something we would set up?

134
00:11:44.785 --> 00:11:54.134
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): That's… isn't ship to location is the standard way of calculating it, right? Yes, exactly. So then, yeah, that's… that'll be your sweet text report, your native suitext report. Okay, perfect.

135
00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:56.779
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): There's no special… Okay.

136
00:11:56.785 --> 00:12:01.094
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Maybe if you don't mind logging into, Luxwan, finding the…

137
00:12:01.635 --> 00:12:06.044
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Journal entries. Give me one second, sir.

138
00:12:06.045 --> 00:12:10.434
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): For tax management, are you… is that topic only sales tax?

139
00:12:11.035 --> 00:12:20.644
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Or… I'm thinking more about asset management, like tax depreciation versus book depreciation. Is that done within NetSuite, or…

140
00:12:20.645 --> 00:12:25.084
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Big SASA module, doesn't work. Yep, that's a big SASA module.

141
00:12:25.665 --> 00:12:40.065
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And we haven't determined yet even what NetSuite edition you guys are going to have. We already know, like, because there's probably 20 different editions, we already know which one fits you best, because that module would be… would be the additional cost, but I think it's, like, $4,000 or something like that.

142
00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:49.720
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): And that's why I just want to know if NetSuite can meet our needs, and do we need that fixed asset stuff?

143
00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:51.870
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): paying for a third party to do that. Bloomberg.

144
00:12:51.875 --> 00:12:57.604
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Yeah, no, no, I know, but I don't know NetSuite's capability. We might not need it. That's what I… I don't know.

145
00:12:57.885 --> 00:13:01.024
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yeah, I think the fixed asset module's gonna handle what you need.

146
00:13:02.355 --> 00:13:16.385
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Journal entries. Let's just talk about that, and talk about allocations in a moment, but journal entries, so you can create journal entries in NetSuite. One of the nice things about journal entries is… well, two things. You can import them, so, like, for your payroll.

147
00:13:16.785 --> 00:13:24.294
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Typically, you're going to import that in as a journal entry, and before you import it in, if you need to identify departments.

148
00:13:24.585 --> 00:13:27.684
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And kind of do allocations and things like that, you can do that.

149
00:13:27.905 --> 00:13:33.854
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): But then you can also create reversal journal, automatically reversal journal entries.

150
00:13:34.065 --> 00:13:37.925
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I'm not sure if you can do that in Core enough. Okay, good.

151
00:13:37.925 --> 00:13:40.045
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): that practice, though? Oh, you have? Okay.

152
00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:40.670
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Excellent.

153
00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:43.580
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Because we couldn't keep track of them. Oh, okay.

154
00:13:43.585 --> 00:13:50.954
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): So, currently, we're getting the data done from Paylocity, and we just upload that data to Core.

155
00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:57.320
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Okay, so we have one… we have one scenario where we plan on you using the

156
00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:00.999
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Bring a journal entry and automatically reverse it, but we'll talk through it.

157
00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:08.219
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Bagging and cash management, we've kind of already talked about this. Now, I don't know if you remember this from the…

158
00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:11.570
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): demos, but we have the Cache360 dashboard.

159
00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:20.050
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So, for cash flow forecasting, so you have some functionality in there that we'll plan on implementing for you. It's actually part of the configured system.

160
00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:31.750
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): The other data point there that we like to just mention again is the pro forma invoice will be another data point. It doesn't flow into the dashboard, so you'll have to kind of just use that as another data point. And then banking…

161
00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:35.179
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Two things to think here is the bank feeds, which…

162
00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:46.849
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I think their bank is part of that, that's great, so we'll plan on that. The free suite app, but we'll plan on setting that up. And then the advanced electronic bill payments, that's part of the addition that we get.

163
00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:55.530
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): That allows you to pay things via ACH, vendor prepayments, which is newer, which is pretty cool. Can you talk a little bit more about what that looks like and feels like?

164
00:14:55.920 --> 00:15:06.310
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yeah, yeah, right from the transaction, like, the normal process flow inside Netsu, the transaction, and then just a couple, checkboxes that you click to,

165
00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:10.009
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): for it to be paid. Then it gets picked up, picked up and paid.

166
00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:11.990
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): not to go to the vet.

167
00:15:11.995 --> 00:15:22.735
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): system is we run a checkmark, we do a checkpoint. It then… there's a report that we dump out of core. It's a HTML file, I think.

168
00:15:22.755 --> 00:15:35.815
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): I then take that file, go log into the bank, upload it as a file. A notcha file? It populates, yeah, it's a notcha file. Populates everything, you know, verify the amounts match, and then it'll…

169
00:15:36.435 --> 00:15:42.275
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): push payments to all those vendors. You're saying that step is skipped. Those payments get pushed to vendors straight from

170
00:15:42.455 --> 00:15:43.465
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Okay. Yeah, from…

171
00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:48.190
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Well, yeah, through the bank payment. Yeah. The bank payment, so yeah, yeah. Now…

172
00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:52.769
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): We have run into issues sometimes with some banks, and the fallback is the NASH file.

173
00:15:52.970 --> 00:16:06.429
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): or something similar to the national filing, depends on what template your bank uses. But at minimum, you'll be able to do the upload of all the payments through the bank. But it sounds like you should be able to do the electronic payments right from Zendesk.

174
00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:15.519
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): And it's… it is not a big-time stuff right now, the way we're doing it, so if we had to stick with the way we're doing it, not a big deal, but, you know, one less step, great, but it is an entrepreneur.

175
00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:16.840
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): to forget.

176
00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:22.740
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Yeah. So, but Mondays, we have a process that Wada or Michael kind of walk in and

177
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.320
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): And propose our payment.

178
00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:41.789
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): run, if you will. They always try to kill me with the amounts, because I wasn't… just erode all our cash. Yeah. But say they walked in with $3 million worth of payments, but in core, they've had to set those all to pay.

179
00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:53.770
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): to review them, and then I get to pick and choose them, and then they gotta go back and unclick them to pay them. So, do we need to do something stuff similar like that in NetSuite? Yeah, something similar.

180
00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:55.200
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): Can we not take a break?

181
00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:56.749
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): to the Rounded Art one.

182
00:16:56.750 --> 00:16:57.820
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): And you said ACH.

183
00:16:57.825 --> 00:17:09.734
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Is it AC… we do 90% ACH, a handful of wires, and then wires, we try to restrict only to international transactions because they're expensive. AC is cheap.

184
00:17:09.964 --> 00:17:15.384
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): And then a little bit of credit card activity, too. The module you're talking about is ACH only?

185
00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:21.079
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): PCH only? Does it have wire? I don't know if it has wire. Depends on your bank account.

186
00:17:21.085 --> 00:17:22.954
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): I don't think that, I mean, I was just curious.

187
00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:23.430
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): If you'd like to…

188
00:17:23.435 --> 00:17:26.024
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): like, building It's okay to death, sir.

189
00:17:26.305 --> 00:17:37.205
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Yeah, there's a PDF. Because even it's not a NACHA file with, wires, we have to go in and manually input those. You have to set them up in the bank portal, and then go and key in the…

190
00:17:37.445 --> 00:17:38.185
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): on.

191
00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:43.190
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): The deal with the ACH, if I remember correctly, you have to register with… I think it's Coastal?

192
00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:49.770
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So there's a service that you have to go through, but we'll… he's gonna pull up the vehicle, we'll get permission.

193
00:17:49.770 --> 00:18:05.199
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): And so then that… that payment cycle or payment report gets checked for everything we want to pay. Do remittances go straight off of that, or do you have to execute or hit buttons? Like, how does that work?

194
00:18:05.205 --> 00:18:09.705
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I don't remember off the top of my head, but let's take it as an action item to get back with you on that.

195
00:18:09.805 --> 00:18:18.165
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Because that's one thing we… we have rate sensitivity about, because if it said we sent it and we didn't, then, you know, that's a problem.

196
00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:21.260
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yeah, that's a good question, we'll get back to that in a bit.

197
00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:23.859
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): And then,

198
00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:33.759
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): So again, that's the only way then to see what our proposed payment cycle is, is to go through that function and review at that point, okay?

199
00:18:33.765 --> 00:18:36.915
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): That's got to be supervisor approval, so we'll just go get 30 to do it.

200
00:18:38.575 --> 00:18:39.825
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Explaina.

201
00:18:39.975 --> 00:18:44.484
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So, like, you don't want anybody to be able to initiate an ACH payment with our…

202
00:18:44.485 --> 00:18:50.024
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Correct, no, no, but, like, WADA or Michael, I want them to compile their proposed

203
00:18:50.475 --> 00:19:00.815
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): payment run, you know, and then they give it to me to look at it, and then I would need to go in and approve it, or is there… Yeah, let's go ahead and approve it.

204
00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:05.600
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yep, we'll map that out, specifically. Is it…

205
00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:08.290
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): Like, through each journal?

206
00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:10.640
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): A payment journal, or how…

207
00:19:10.645 --> 00:19:17.435
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): this, how does it get cheated up? So, it's a bill payment, and that bill payment will pay multiple bills.

208
00:19:17.955 --> 00:19:20.795
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And then, so it'll be the bill payment that gets queued up.

209
00:19:20.935 --> 00:19:25.695
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And then the payment method on the bill payment is really what is defining that this is going to be ACH.

210
00:19:26.665 --> 00:19:33.455
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Okay, and so when we propose that, then we say we select all the ones that we needed to pay, she goes in there, she approves it.

211
00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:38.559
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): Can she remove it, or she just tells us what you want, and then we remove it?

212
00:19:38.565 --> 00:19:45.664
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yeah, again, I don't remember that part, I'm sorry. It's been so long since I've done this. Okay. But we'll come back to you on that. Okay.

213
00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:50.040
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Everything's done within next week. Yeah. We don't have to go to the bank for ACH payments.

214
00:19:50.285 --> 00:19:58.314
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): thus, for some reason, there's some issue with your bank, and the fallback option would be an international file that you upload, and then we have the argument that suite.

215
00:19:58.445 --> 00:20:01.065
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): similar to what you're doing right now. Yeah.

216
00:20:01.065 --> 00:20:05.675
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): deposits, I think we still have to go into the bank, because we have positive pay.

217
00:20:05.825 --> 00:20:09.785
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Raptors still review the transactions on the bank portal?

218
00:20:10.205 --> 00:20:21.504
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): I know the bank and NetSuite is connected, so I have to validate the transaction in NetSuite, right? Yeah. But we still have to go into the bank portal to do positive pay.

219
00:20:21.505 --> 00:20:22.625
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): Yeah, me too, but…

220
00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:23.200
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): We don'.

221
00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:23.579
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): I know that.

222
00:20:24.135 --> 00:20:27.514
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Okay. Because we haven't talked to the bank about being connected to NetSuite.

223
00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:33.340
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): Our current process requires us to do that, but we don't know if the new process will require us to do.

224
00:20:33.345 --> 00:20:38.615
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): We'll definitely take it… one action item for us is to dig a little bit deeper in this to get you some more information. Okay.

225
00:20:40.905 --> 00:20:51.855
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And then the consultant that'll be on the implementation will make sure that they've… we have consultants that have set this up multiple times. It's been years since I've done this. I don't remember.

226
00:20:53.835 --> 00:20:59.815
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So that was journal entries. Oh, we talked about allocations, you just manually doing allocations, you said, right?

227
00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:00.430
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): We don't create.

228
00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:01.180
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): any POA.

229
00:21:01.185 --> 00:21:03.054
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): P&Ls that show allocation.

230
00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:03.580
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): They're just on.

231
00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:05.949
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): paper. Okay. That's why we don't…

232
00:21:05.955 --> 00:21:06.425
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): too.

233
00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:07.770
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): want to? I don't think.

234
00:21:07.775 --> 00:21:08.295
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So I don't.

235
00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:08.700
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Okay.

236
00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:10.539
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): To see that.

237
00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:11.180
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Right.

238
00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:12.420
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): Yeah, we don't have it.

239
00:21:12.425 --> 00:21:13.715
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): I mean, I don't know that he'.

240
00:21:13.715 --> 00:21:15.274
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): He knows that he wants to, or doesn't.

241
00:21:16.355 --> 00:21:19.504
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): Because these numbers were never offered heavy. Okay.

242
00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:21.570
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And…

243
00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:31.840
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): We talk about the bank feeds, and the bank feeds, your bank is part of that, so that means that the banking information will flow into NetSuite automatically for reconciliation.

244
00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:33.960
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): That'll be pretty nice.

245
00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:42.129
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): They'll do the auto-matching, and then you can create rules to help with that auto-matching, make that easier and easier over time.

246
00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:47.360
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And do you guys use corporate credit cards?

247
00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:50.329
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): We do, and they're currently through ARC Bank.

248
00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:56.549
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): And it's a very manual process, how we get it into the jail.

249
00:21:57.250 --> 00:21:58.020
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Okay.

250
00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:03.709
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yeah, so the way that NetSuite does this, it treats it like, almost like another bank account.

251
00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:09.500
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And so, either… I don't know if it has a live feed, I don't think it does, but I think you just have to upload the statement.

252
00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:13.669
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So I export it as a CSV, import it, and then you use the same bank

253
00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:19.169
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): But the same reconciliation process you do for your bank. You can use it for your credit cards, too.

254
00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:20.899
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): That makes it a lot easier.

255
00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:42.239
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): So, but right now, like, the one thing that we actually process our credit cards is through our third-party Expensify, which is where we do expense reports, because that's where the user gets to attach the receipts and the coding, and that's where we do that up front, and…

256
00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:51.700
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): And then from that, we get a manual file that's dumped, and then my AP team takes it and codes it into the GL, so…

257
00:22:51.870 --> 00:23:05.139
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): But there's obviously a lot of work there up front with the… with the users going in and creating their expense reports to match the bank statement, and, you know, Matt has a lot of lines that he has to manage, and… I just don't do it.

258
00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:08.180
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): I suppose that my others are cold.

259
00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:10.020
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): So.

260
00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:15.060
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): So, in… in the system you just said, how…

261
00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:22.700
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): If it's… if it's automatically fed with the bank and stuff, is there a way to attach receipts and do all that?

262
00:23:22.705 --> 00:23:33.515
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): No, I think that, since you're using Expensify, he's gonna pull it up right now. There is an Expensify integration with Suite. Oh, okay. There's a suite app for it. Okay. And so, we'll… we will pull up information on that.

263
00:23:34.050 --> 00:23:39.129
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): And… Absolutely talk to each other. You can just sync data into…

264
00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:44.089
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yep, and yeah, so if you can…

265
00:23:45.370 --> 00:23:50.270
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I think there's probably a PDF, too, so that's a little 2DF for me to look into them, but we can also.

266
00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:52.370
Cornerstone: Get a dental scheduled.

267
00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:53.520
Cornerstone: with them.

268
00:23:54.650 --> 00:24:00.560
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): Do you want them to see if there's also one for the… for RAMP that you're talking to?

269
00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:09.780
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): Currently on one, but Lorraine is interested in moving to RAM, so… Okay. RAM doesn't have an integration with NetSuite.

270
00:24:09.785 --> 00:24:13.735
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): It does? Yes. Okay, so, you know, we can potentially do both.

271
00:24:14.335 --> 00:24:18.795
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): As far as captured receipts from a user perspective, it's really nice.

272
00:24:20.575 --> 00:24:22.365
Cornerstone: Boom, get actually assigned to it.

273
00:24:22.365 --> 00:24:34.555
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yes. It would be nice. A bit nice. Who likes to do expense reports? That's why I made Chris buy everything.

274
00:24:35.405 --> 00:24:40.734
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So that was credit card management, and then just since we're on the topic, you can accept credit cards inside NetSuite?

275
00:24:41.095 --> 00:24:43.355
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Xpsac compliant.

276
00:24:43.475 --> 00:24:47.045
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): But most dealers I talk to don't want anything to do with credit cards.

277
00:24:47.205 --> 00:24:47.805
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So…

278
00:24:47.805 --> 00:24:50.514
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): We, we currently use,

279
00:24:51.550 --> 00:24:56.990
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): It's typed Stripe. That's it, Stripe. Okay. That's how we get our…

280
00:24:57.540 --> 00:25:01.349
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Yeah, it's just very rare we take a credit card. Yeah, we try, because we charge… they charge.

281
00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:03.270
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): Yeah. What does Steve think?

282
00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:13.049
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): Okay, but we do have the option for people to pay for it, whatever. So, if it's built in, and we can just use theirs, and their fee is normal, then we can get rid of Stripe.

283
00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:17.959
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So, there's a… there's a host of, ones to choose from.

284
00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:20.100
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Right, you still end up paying.

285
00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:22.219
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And it's all based on,

286
00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:28.029
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): How many transactions? So, I always plan on paying 3%.

287
00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:33.240
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yeah. Because people use rewards cards, and you get homes with those rewards cards. It's the biggest scam ever.

288
00:25:33.670 --> 00:25:35.170
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Get the merchant pay for it.

289
00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:36.690
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So…

290
00:25:36.890 --> 00:25:41.709
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): The only benefit… well, are you using Stripe so you can put the payment link in the invoice?

291
00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:47.340
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Yes. When we do remove the hyperlink, is it still there?

292
00:25:47.345 --> 00:25:49.605
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): credit card is still there, really removed…

293
00:25:49.605 --> 00:25:53.054
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Association of patients information. And then we also have a,

294
00:25:53.385 --> 00:25:58.114
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): URL that we can send to clients, or they can go to the… Okay.

295
00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:06.360
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So that's why when most dealers are using it for that, really. It's just to have the paper link on the invoice, so it helps to get payment easily, but

296
00:26:06.490 --> 00:26:13.470
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yeah, there's… if you're using Stripe, you're fine, and if you… it's, like, incidental, then…

297
00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:17.319
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): We're gonna pay for it, or just the processing fee?

298
00:26:17.650 --> 00:26:18.639
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): Supervisor Amy.

299
00:26:18.645 --> 00:26:19.405
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): processing.

300
00:26:19.405 --> 00:26:20.165
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): There's no…

301
00:26:20.165 --> 00:26:23.384
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): No, it's a transaction purchase. Oh, that's fine, I can just stay there.

302
00:26:23.775 --> 00:26:27.294
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Okay, we pay an annual fee for that gal to host that?

303
00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:30.410
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): Signed or whatever, it's like $100.

304
00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:32.880
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): What site are we hosting? It's like…

305
00:26:32.885 --> 00:26:37.435
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): she built it for us, and she's hosting it. It's not on our website.

306
00:26:37.605 --> 00:26:38.405
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Oh, I know, love it.

307
00:26:38.405 --> 00:26:40.365
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): What's that?

308
00:26:40.365 --> 00:26:43.515
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): It's been away for a long time, yeah, we can move it. Okay.

309
00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:48.370
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): All right, period closes.

310
00:26:48.375 --> 00:26:49.975
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): There was a spinner down, I'd say.

311
00:26:49.975 --> 00:26:52.684
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): We have no access to it. I'm sorry.

312
00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:58.549
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Period close. How long does it typically take for you to close your account grants? 10 days. 10 days.

313
00:26:59.870 --> 00:27:05.299
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Like, and then, is in CORE, is there a step-by-step process, or do you have your own?

314
00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:18.920
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): We do everything on… in Excel. Okay. And that's what I was asking you, I think, a day or so ago. In prior lives, I've used, online systems called Blackline or Flowcast, that kind of does that, not in…

315
00:27:19.030 --> 00:27:27.749
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): ERP, but it ends up connecting in the ERP, because it'll attach things, so that's why I wasn't sure what you guys offer, what's out there.

316
00:27:27.755 --> 00:27:40.825
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): NetSuite has their own closing period checklist that walks you through, and there's a number of things you kind of step through to do it. It's pretty quick. There's actually kind of a… there's, like, a quick feature or a step-by-step feature that you can go through.

317
00:27:40.975 --> 00:27:43.635
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So I would recommend using that.

318
00:27:43.835 --> 00:27:45.245
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Inside the system.

319
00:27:45.910 --> 00:27:54.159
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): But how does it work in there? So right now, we, you know, we have APAR module, we're able to close and open an APAR module, and also a GR module.

320
00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:57.429
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): So for next week, we just…

321
00:27:57.970 --> 00:28:01.290
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Open everything at once, close everything at once, or…

322
00:28:01.615 --> 00:28:06.195
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): you can open… so, like, what I would typically do is I open the whole year at once.

323
00:28:06.275 --> 00:28:25.595
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And then set a reminder in my calendar in December to open the next year. I can't tell you how many times we stumbled into January and we couldn't do transactions, because we've got to open up the next accounting period year. But I don't typically like to go more than a year, because then people can make the mistake of choosing a transaction in the future and throws things off.

324
00:28:25.725 --> 00:28:30.135
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And then when you're closing, you can close ARAP and go through the checklist.

325
00:28:30.135 --> 00:28:33.115
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Got it. So that's… Yeah.

326
00:28:33.285 --> 00:28:41.404
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And then one thing I do recommend is, you can close the accounting period, but leave non-GL changes available.

327
00:28:41.795 --> 00:28:46.974
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So, like, because what happens is you close the counting period, and somebody wants to go make a note.

328
00:28:47.255 --> 00:28:58.344
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): It's only been 10 days, or 11 days, and when I go make a note on a transaction, and they can't, it's locked. So, you can set this by default, and that's what I typically do, is to allow non-GL changes by default.

329
00:29:00.405 --> 00:29:11.255
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): But that's a decision. I don't know if… how you guys do it now, like, if it's locked-locked and nobody can edit it, or… and… because I always just have people coming in and asking me, can you please unlock that so I can add this

330
00:29:11.545 --> 00:29:13.764
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): node or whatever to the track? I think Core doesn't need it.

331
00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:18.940
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): I think the only changes you can't make after period is locked are due after you haul them back.

332
00:29:19.695 --> 00:29:20.465
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): Yeah, cause…

333
00:29:20.465 --> 00:29:24.944
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): No one's ever talked to me about closing a period and not being able to get a customer.

334
00:29:24.945 --> 00:29:30.185
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So it sounds like that's something we could probably plan on now, is to allow the field changes.

335
00:29:30.615 --> 00:29:32.905
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So for the sake of the transcript, we got that.

336
00:29:36.815 --> 00:29:44.084
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): -Oh, If you go to reopen the period, for whatever reason, the cost engine will run simply.

337
00:29:44.090 --> 00:29:55.780
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): careful with that transaction. I'm sorry, one more time. The cost engine, there's a cost engine in NetSuite that runs depending on what type of cost engine you're using. So, just be careful if you reopen a period

338
00:29:56.190 --> 00:30:00.279
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): That cost engine could pick it up and back for financials for that period.

339
00:30:00.585 --> 00:30:09.145
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Let me explore that a little bit more. Within a fiscal year, it would… it would still do that, or crossing a period? I mean, crossing a fiscal year.

340
00:30:09.145 --> 00:30:11.844
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): lot numbered, right? They're a lot, Steven? Okay, then you're.

341
00:30:11.845 --> 00:30:19.955
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): Probably okay. I've seen it more with average cost now. Oh, yeah, and it just drives everybody. Okay, no, no.

342
00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:21.300
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yeah.

343
00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:24.060
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): We'll talk about pricing in just a minute, actually.

344
00:30:24.065 --> 00:30:29.785
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): No, and that's… I mean, honestly, when we close the fiscal year and then we're done with our internal close.

345
00:30:31.415 --> 00:30:34.925
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): We actually only go back and open it to post-audit.

346
00:30:35.585 --> 00:30:38.755
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Adjustments, nothing else, you know, so…

347
00:30:39.790 --> 00:30:46.810
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yep, and you close… and just so you know, I think we're on the same page, but you… you close each month. Yes. Each counting period. Okay, yeah, gotcha.

348
00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:52.299
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Any other financial controls?

349
00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:58.229
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): That we need to consider, that you either have or you don't have and want.

350
00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:00.819
Cornerstone: I know that's a pretty…

351
00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:05.010
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Broad question, so feel free to take a moment to think about that, but…

352
00:31:05.150 --> 00:31:08.319
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I just don't want to skip over that and go too fast and…

353
00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:14.619
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): True, are you talking about access? Like, who can access?

354
00:31:15.370 --> 00:31:18.680
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Or checks and balances? Yeah, I know.

355
00:31:18.685 --> 00:31:20.274
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): I know that something has come up.

356
00:31:20.415 --> 00:31:25.335
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Pretty frequently is, Having to set up recurring,

357
00:31:25.845 --> 00:31:36.414
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): AP, like, rent. I'd love to set up rent, so it's just in there, and it'll post on the first every month. Nope, can't do that. I can enter all the transactions manually, but .

358
00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:51.919
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): That would be nice, and… Well, before you move on, let me just comment on this, because I'll forget. Yeah. So we have that, it's called Memorized Transactions. Nice. So if you want that, we can plan for that. Just let us know how many of those transactions you would anticipate. Is that something you'd be interested in, Loren.

359
00:31:51.925 --> 00:32:02.105
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): And I've also found that, like, they have occasions where it would be really nice to upload AP via a CSV file. It sounds like you can do that, because you said.

360
00:32:02.215 --> 00:32:04.685
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): is done that way, so I assume.

361
00:32:04.685 --> 00:32:09.335
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Journal entry, but you can also create vendor bills from the CSV. Correct.

362
00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:12.270
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Here, here's a cow. Here's a cow.

363
00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:16.390
Cornerstone: Voiding invoices.

364
00:32:18.510 --> 00:32:27.109
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Overarching, it's a big no-no that we're not supposed to be doing it, but there's a lot of reasons and rationales of why we do do it.

365
00:32:27.670 --> 00:32:40.610
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Or why people want to do it. So, there's a whole… but there's nothing right now in CORE that invalidates anybody from doing it, so my AR team can just invoid invoices.

366
00:32:40.905 --> 00:32:41.644
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): Just have the invoicing.

367
00:32:41.650 --> 00:32:42.400
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Invoices to the.

368
00:32:42.405 --> 00:32:43.905
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): That's incoming.

369
00:32:43.905 --> 00:32:50.665
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So, that's good, because actually NetSuite calls and invoices for the customer, bills for the vendor. Yeah, so…

370
00:32:50.670 --> 00:33:06.589
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): in what we bill our clients, again, for all the myriad of reasons, again, when we did it, and then it comes back, like, oh, no, that's wrong, wrong timing, this, did it, can we just invoice and stuff? So, anyway, so from our bank audit perspective, that's a big no-no. We get… Yeah, if it's outside.

371
00:33:06.595 --> 00:33:07.455
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): the same month.

372
00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:08.470
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): Outside of the same.

373
00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:09.020
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Correct. Oh, yeah.

374
00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:22.219
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): So, but yet there's no control to stop it from happening. We have people call me, or email me, and this and that, because they know, but there's no control in it right now, I mean, or…

375
00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:28.350
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Gotcha. Yeah, so you can void, you can also delete, if you have the permission to.

376
00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:35.009
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And I'm sure that there's a permission for voiding invoices. A normal practice is.

377
00:33:35.010 --> 00:33:41.569
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): void and rebirth. But once you void, you have to do a rebirth right away, so it replaced the old invoice. Yeah.

378
00:33:41.570 --> 00:33:46.099
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): Yeah, you would limit it by… you would control it by role space. Yeah, you can stop them.

379
00:33:46.330 --> 00:33:47.400
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): Yeah. Yeah.

380
00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:50.610
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): But let me just, out of curiosity, like.

381
00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:57.340
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Like, if you were the only one that had the ability to delete, It just went away.

382
00:33:57.950 --> 00:34:01.290
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Well, no, but that's the thing, like, Matt…

383
00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:08.159
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Matt, again, we're dual admins kind of stuff and stuff, yeah, so… Is that better?

384
00:34:08.165 --> 00:34:10.415
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): Delete… is there a record that it was deleted?

385
00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:14.299
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yeah, you can turn that on, and it'll keep track of the fact that you deleted it.

386
00:34:14.304 --> 00:34:17.164
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): A lot of trim. Oh, I don't like that.

387
00:34:17.165 --> 00:34:17.904
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): Yeah. No.

388
00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:18.659
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): Yeah, and I love that.

389
00:34:18.665 --> 00:34:20.165
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): I don't trust you.

390
00:34:20.165 --> 00:34:20.905
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Obviously.

391
00:34:20.909 --> 00:34:23.709
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): And if somebody gets in with your… like, we've been…

392
00:34:24.079 --> 00:34:29.279
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): Like, full half. Oh, really? Like, lost a million dollars at it. Oh, wow. Ransomware, or…

393
00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:29.960
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): No.

394
00:34:29.969 --> 00:34:41.219
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): they hacked one of their emails and started manipulating our invoices. Oh, wow. So, like, if somebody got your credentials, and you had delete, and there's no audit trail, I don't love that. Okay. Yeah.

395
00:34:41.225 --> 00:34:46.864
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Since I created our program, our security program, do you guys use, like, a password manager?

396
00:34:47.405 --> 00:34:53.104
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): We do everything through opt-in. Oh, okay, so single sign-on, I'm sorry, so it should, it should be, okay, gotcha.

397
00:34:53.405 --> 00:34:57.885
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Okay, yeah, so… so, permission to void, locked down to you guys.

398
00:34:58.395 --> 00:35:03.874
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Generally, you know, only admins, like, a few of the.

399
00:35:03.875 --> 00:35:09.775
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): admin could delete, and then you could, you know… Is Frank having only true admins, or it could be a meeting?

400
00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:15.750
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): Well, whoever has admin, you know, rights in their role, but.

401
00:35:16.105 --> 00:35:27.344
Speaker 10 (Cornerstone): And there's something called a delete reason, and then you can activate that, so that if you do delete a record, then it makes you put in, and you can put your initials and the date, and this is why it was deleted.

402
00:35:27.345 --> 00:35:29.884
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): It's been a nice feature in the last few years. Yeah, I'm really vital.

403
00:35:29.890 --> 00:35:31.480
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): Just literally just go away.

404
00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:32.980
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): Yeah, and .

405
00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:33.530
Speaker 10 (Cornerstone): dairy.

406
00:35:34.105 --> 00:35:34.844
Speaker 10 (Cornerstone): Yeah. Police care.

407
00:35:34.850 --> 00:35:35.600
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): I feel that for you.

408
00:35:35.605 --> 00:35:45.344
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Is there a difference between void and delete? Oh, yeah. Okay, okay, so, because void still keeps it out there, which is, I think, what we want to see, the visibility. Yes, delete it.

409
00:35:45.345 --> 00:35:46.085
Speaker 10 (Cornerstone): Completely ghosted.

410
00:35:46.090 --> 00:35:48.439
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): Oh, gosh, can we disable deleting?

411
00:35:48.445 --> 00:35:56.604
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): I don't know that we never… Delete it. I've been avoiding… I like it on a trail. I don't like deleting, because then it's just… it scares me, yeah.

412
00:35:56.605 --> 00:35:59.084
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): about the leading is sometimes it gets messy.

413
00:35:59.455 --> 00:36:02.474
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): You make a mistake, Yeah, it's more acceptable.

414
00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:03.400
Speaker 10 (Cornerstone): I can go, oh god.

415
00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:03.830
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): I'm…

416
00:36:03.830 --> 00:36:07.169
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): I say, like, notice that you have 9 voided invoices

417
00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:10.580
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): Like, so it just depends on how clean of it.

418
00:36:10.585 --> 00:36:14.754
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yeah, there's usually only one or two people that can… Yes, exactly.

419
00:36:15.765 --> 00:36:23.455
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Our customer financial management. We talked about statements already in a previous session, providing customer statements,

420
00:36:24.405 --> 00:36:29.895
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): You know, what we didn't talk about was parent-child relationships with customers.

421
00:36:30.395 --> 00:36:31.335
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So…

422
00:36:32.935 --> 00:36:34.324
Cornerstone: That's a big topic.

423
00:36:34.515 --> 00:36:38.214
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Maybe we should come back to it, but let me just introduce it.

424
00:36:39.795 --> 00:36:44.315
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So, this comes into play a lot with the alternative bill, too, for third-party billing.

425
00:36:44.455 --> 00:36:50.465
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And who is the customer? Who's the end user? Who are you actually transacting with?

426
00:36:51.075 --> 00:36:55.814
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): We… we tend to track all that by using the alternative bill tube.

427
00:36:56.585 --> 00:36:59.254
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): that's how we tend to do it. So, what we'll say is.

428
00:36:59.375 --> 00:37:08.304
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Google is your customer on the transaction, and then the alternative bill to will be your GC, and then at the last minute, when you generate the invoice, it flips.

429
00:37:08.495 --> 00:37:12.325
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): the GC becomes the customer on the invoice.

430
00:37:12.445 --> 00:37:17.805
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Google's still the customer on the sales order, right, so your AR agent shows the GC

431
00:37:17.985 --> 00:37:20.704
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And then, yeah, then your sales reports show Google.

432
00:37:20.905 --> 00:37:24.225
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So that's how we typically like to do it. Is that… Yes.

433
00:37:24.225 --> 00:37:36.875
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): That's better than the way we do it now, because I think all of our reporting now shows Google, so then you think, oh, I need to call Google about this, and then you dig into it, it's like, no, I don't, I need to call the GC, that one's being billed.

434
00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:44.479
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): Okay. Well, it depends on how it's set up on the front end. If they use the third-party billing, then it will show up as the third-party bill. That's it? On our ARI board?

435
00:37:44.485 --> 00:37:47.455
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): I thought it showed the customer. I know what.

436
00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:56.029
Uyen Dang: It's so whoever the bill to is. You could have Google as the customer, and if you change third-party to a GC.

437
00:37:56.030 --> 00:38:02.299
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): The GG is on our aging, and it's where the invoice will go to. It's where the bill goes.

438
00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:05.779
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): set up wrong. People don't understand what third-party billing is.

439
00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:11.979
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Leasing, too, is a situation right now. Leasing agency gets a billing, rather than the end user. Yep.

440
00:38:11.985 --> 00:38:18.254
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): That's good. Other scenario is a parent-child relationships. So, NetSuite allows you to do something where

441
00:38:18.995 --> 00:38:21.644
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I see this a lot with dealers, like, with,

442
00:38:22.125 --> 00:38:26.994
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): universities. So, Ohio State University.

443
00:38:27.425 --> 00:38:30.064
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): They will sometimes buy from the dealer.

444
00:38:30.225 --> 00:38:38.585
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And then, at other times, a particular department at Ohio State will buy from the dealer. We have Stanford. Okay, Stanford.

445
00:38:38.585 --> 00:38:42.325
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): Stanford University, and then you have every school at Stanford University as its home.

446
00:38:42.325 --> 00:39:00.744
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): entity. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, so we do that all the time. Okay, so you can have this relationship where Stanford is the parent, and the other ones are the children, and then typically you're probably going to be invoicing the children, right? Yes. But there are times when we run into where at the last minute, it's like, oh, no, actually, Stanford's going to be paying that bill.

447
00:39:00.775 --> 00:39:11.045
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So NetSuite allows you to do something called consolidated payments, so the parent could pay the bill for the children if you want them, as long as you set that relationship up.

448
00:39:11.125 --> 00:39:13.325
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Doesn't have to be that way, though. It's optional.

449
00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:19.210
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Good to have. Good to have it. I have not seen that at all in my two years here.

450
00:39:19.215 --> 00:39:19.955
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): I'm using…

451
00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:20.700
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): or negative.

452
00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:29.819
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): for Intuit, when Intuit acquired MailChimp, while we're in the middle of the MailChimp project, it did change from MailChimp to Intuit was paying the bill. Okay. So…

453
00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:31.190
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): It doesn't.

454
00:39:31.195 --> 00:39:34.055
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): things very common, really. Happens a lot.

455
00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:35.120
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): And brick.

456
00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:49.559
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): cases, we run AR report like that, but when we submit, like, line of credit report, they require us to lump these, you know, childs together into, like, a parent line. Okay. And then report them as one entity.

457
00:39:49.565 --> 00:39:50.705
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Thank you. Yes.

458
00:39:50.705 --> 00:39:51.465
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): heck. Absolutely.

459
00:39:51.465 --> 00:39:55.015
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): We'll plan on parent-child relationships for these types of scenarios.

460
00:39:56.825 --> 00:40:00.175
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): the deal. All right, let's…

461
00:40:00.305 --> 00:40:14.765
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): change order, therefore, and do revenue and cost recognition first, and then project accounting. Chris has the document. Oh, I was kind of like… I had my… I had my chat turned off. I keep getting top partners.

462
00:40:16.505 --> 00:40:18.275
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): You're like, so?

463
00:40:18.535 --> 00:40:20.775
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): You're not gonna help me out at all, are you?

464
00:40:22.535 --> 00:40:24.045
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Give me one second, everybody.

465
00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:37.550
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): Thank you.

466
00:40:49.450 --> 00:40:50.460
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Very simple.

467
00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:02.990
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): I don't know asleep.

468
00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:09.060
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Oh, okay.

469
00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:18.599
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Tactical difficulties via PolarCo.

470
00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:26.710
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Thank you.

471
00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:30.910
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): We all started.

472
00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:39.020
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): Talks amongst yourselves.

473
00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:44.880
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): review a topic, trying to think of all the good ones.

474
00:41:45.130 --> 00:41:49.970
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Something very political. No, I'm joking. Religious. Yeah.

475
00:41:51.270 --> 00:41:59.370
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): Just as uncomfortable. The one I always remember from coffee touches… I'll give you a topic. A Judas preachs. He's either a Jew nor a priest.

476
00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:05.510
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): The Mormon Tabernacle Choir.

477
00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:09.590
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): They're comfortable.

478
00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:12.820
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Going.

479
00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:20.220
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I'm here somewhere.

480
00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:24.650
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): Nope, nope, nope.

481
00:42:25.970 --> 00:42:28.260
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Okay, I have you here somewhere, hold on a second.

482
00:42:29.050 --> 00:42:29.950
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Just here.

483
00:42:32.810 --> 00:42:34.760
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And I never had so much trouble with.

484
00:42:36.780 --> 00:42:40.550
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): She reached everything, so…

485
00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:44.050
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): I don't know, I don't remember. Nope.

486
00:42:44.810 --> 00:42:46.839
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): I finished all the dessert from yesterday.

487
00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:48.559
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): This top is open.

488
00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:54.970
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): But then they host teams. Oh, I bet you it was open and seeing this.

489
00:42:57.230 --> 00:42:58.540
Cornerstone: Good deal.

490
00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:05.280
Cornerstone: Into one of the music here?

491
00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:12.380
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I'm gonna just share the screen.

492
00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:16.309
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Or you sleep?

493
00:43:17.890 --> 00:43:22.630
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I'm gonna need you to download the topic of the conversation.

494
00:43:25.370 --> 00:43:32.419
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Otherwise, I'm going to get bombarded with messages.

495
00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:34.210
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): In the book.

496
00:43:49.890 --> 00:43:52.020
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Can't afford a course. Okay, that is not.

497
00:43:52.135 --> 00:43:54.354
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I want to thank you all for your patience.

498
00:43:59.295 --> 00:44:00.635
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): There we go. Alright.

499
00:44:01.935 --> 00:44:15.535
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Revenue and cost recognition. So we have a white paper that we're going to leave with you, so you can read over this multiple times, because this is different. The way that that recognizes revenue and cost is different than… Of course.

500
00:44:15.895 --> 00:44:23.534
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Now, the good news is… Well, at least for us. This is how every other enterprise ERP does it.

501
00:44:23.605 --> 00:44:40.374
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So, NetSuite's not unique, it's actually a core that's a little bit unique, and team design. Yeah. So, we'll just… we'll kind of walk through this white paper, we'll talk… we won't read it word for word, we'll talk about the overall… the topic. So, NetSuite is absolutely following Gap when it comes to, revenue and cost.

502
00:44:44.345 --> 00:44:57.884
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): the revenue recognition philosophy is we do want to do matching, so we want to match revenue in the same period that cost is being recognized. Now, inside of NetSuite, different than Core, it's really cost that's driving this.

503
00:44:58.585 --> 00:45:05.305
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): process? Cost. It's driving the, is really the first driver, and then…

504
00:45:05.465 --> 00:45:08.695
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): revenue comes after cost. So, what happens is.

505
00:45:09.555 --> 00:45:12.034
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): This is where I wish I had a whiteboard for this, but…

506
00:45:12.235 --> 00:45:22.275
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): the product comes into the warehouse on an item receipt. That's what it impacts with. So it hits with the item receipt. Right now, for core, I think they hit the vendor bill, right?

507
00:45:23.130 --> 00:45:33.589
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): when we approve a vendor invoice, AP. So we got an AP invoice, we entered into the system. Yeah, because we matched the lines. Yeah, it's worth it.

508
00:45:33.710 --> 00:45:44.169
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So, this is going to be a little bit earlier, because it's when you receive it, which is important, another reason why it's important to receive it, if it's going to a third-party warehouse, is that that will hit your… hit your WIP asset account.

509
00:45:45.330 --> 00:45:50.840
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Then, when it is fulfilled, is when the cost is recognized.

510
00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:58.430
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So, fulfilled… the fulfillment is a process in NetSuite, and it's basically tracking when it leaves your warehouse.

511
00:45:58.850 --> 00:46:00.440
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Whether you have…

512
00:46:00.580 --> 00:46:07.460
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): the warehouse on your physical location, or you're tracking the third-party warehouse. When it leaves, that's when the cost is going to be recognized.

513
00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:17.110
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Now, revenue is recognized totally independent of that. Revenue is recognized when you create a… you generate a customer invoice.

514
00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:22.100
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And all those things are really separate. They're separate… they're not tied together.

515
00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:26.619
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So, but I think, if I remember correctly, core is when you generate a customer invoice.

516
00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:29.180
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): That's when cost is recognized, correct? Correct.

517
00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:32.060
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Revenue and expense to recognize at that moment. Yeah.

518
00:46:32.065 --> 00:46:41.825
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): revenue is really the driver there. Boston's been recognized. So this is different. It's… they're divorced from each other, and this is how it's typically done in ERPs.

519
00:46:41.825 --> 00:46:42.795
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): So, I'm…

520
00:46:42.795 --> 00:46:46.314
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): the saying I'm going to end up front-loading cost.

521
00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:51.780
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): And timing different to the revenue, if I'm not building at the same time that it's shipping.

522
00:46:51.780 --> 00:46:52.350
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): So we have.

523
00:46:52.355 --> 00:46:53.145
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): we have…

524
00:46:53.335 --> 00:47:01.505
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Plans for all of that. Okay. Yeah, yeah. So, a couple things also to think about here is the cost

525
00:47:01.835 --> 00:47:13.765
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): kind of fulfillment is created, cost is recognized, so WIP is relieved, COGS is recognized, and then, likely, somewhere in that period, your customer invoice is generated.

526
00:47:13.905 --> 00:47:19.165
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And if that happens in the same accounting period, you're good. You're matching, right? Right. If it doesn't happen.

527
00:47:19.395 --> 00:47:22.675
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): What we have is a report that says, hey, here are all the lines.

528
00:47:22.825 --> 00:47:29.114
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): That were on a kind of fulfillment, which means cost was recognized, but they were not on a customer invoice.

529
00:47:29.635 --> 00:47:36.965
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So, we aggregate that amount, and then you create a journal entry that… and accrue the revenue, and it automatically reverses

530
00:47:37.175 --> 00:47:38.864
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): On the first day of the next period.

531
00:47:39.135 --> 00:47:48.565
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Don't have to do journal entry. You have to do a journal entry. And we have that report for both ways. So, if for some reason there was revenue that was recognized in that cost.

532
00:47:48.755 --> 00:47:52.154
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): That will, you can… you can accrue the cost as well.

533
00:47:52.455 --> 00:47:54.765
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): You only have to do one journal entry for all of it.

534
00:47:55.665 --> 00:48:01.614
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So it's a pretty simple process. You could even automate it, and then put it in an unapproved state for you to approve it.

535
00:48:02.085 --> 00:48:03.975
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And then both, and then posted.

536
00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:13.870
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): He said the cost is recognized when it's… Builder received.

537
00:48:14.420 --> 00:48:14.900
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): film.

538
00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:16.110
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): to find…

539
00:48:16.110 --> 00:48:16.690
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): Bill.

540
00:48:16.850 --> 00:48:18.360
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Leaves in the warehouse.

541
00:48:18.365 --> 00:48:20.035
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): somewhere else. We should have something to…

542
00:48:20.035 --> 00:48:20.955
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): There it goes.

543
00:48:21.125 --> 00:48:22.525
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): goes to Brax.

544
00:48:23.070 --> 00:48:30.550
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So, yeah, if it's a dropship scenario, there's a different GL impact, and we'll come back to that, but I just want to make sure there were

545
00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:48.290
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): We're still talking about this scenario where you're ordering it, it's pre-sold inventory, you have it on a sales order, you're procuring it, it's going to your third-party warehouse with the intention of going to your client. That will be… that's that GL impact for that method.

546
00:48:48.620 --> 00:48:53.209
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): for the dropships here, or what… sorry, I think you guys called it different… you call it a different dropship?

547
00:48:53.215 --> 00:48:53.825
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): than Trump.

548
00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:58.739
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yeah, so if it's going directly to the end user, bypassing all that.

549
00:48:59.030 --> 00:49:01.879
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Boss is recognized, with the vendor belt.

550
00:49:02.780 --> 00:49:04.280
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Bypasses all of that.

551
00:49:06.190 --> 00:49:11.140
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): In that case, it's the same as call. You get the better invoice. We'll recognize the call.

552
00:49:11.145 --> 00:49:14.905
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Oh, so Core is hitting WIP at Vanderbilt, right? Yes.

553
00:49:15.095 --> 00:49:20.504
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): When does it… when does Core recognize cost? Oh, when it comes on your invoice. Yeah, yeah, so…

554
00:49:20.875 --> 00:49:24.724
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): It's only when… so, no, it's not the same as core. Okay. Yep.

555
00:49:25.090 --> 00:49:29.929
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): What if… I don't know how much Shanna was in here. I don't know how…

556
00:49:31.350 --> 00:49:38.520
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Kimmy, you might know. Like, is everything… do we have a policy about everything has to be marked, received? Does she run reports?

557
00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:45.650
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Because if receiving… is what's driving things posting to the GL, the cost side.

558
00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:50.729
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): we have to receive everything, or it won't ever hit the GL, is that right?

559
00:49:50.735 --> 00:49:51.665
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): RC?

560
00:49:51.710 --> 00:49:59.830
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): The receiving, is that posting it to WIT? Yes. The receipt transaction. Yeah. Posted to WIT.

561
00:49:59.835 --> 00:50:04.255
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): What if we have an order and no one bothers to mark it received? You'll never input.

562
00:50:04.260 --> 00:50:04.990
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Bob.

563
00:50:04.990 --> 00:50:18.360
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): It's in limbo. Yeah, then once you go… well, and then you won't be able to bill it. So once you get to the… you get the vendor invoice, or the vendor bill from the vendor, and you go, oh, I need to bill this PO, oh, I never received it, you hit receive, now I hit bill.

564
00:50:18.570 --> 00:50:22.219
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): But it's… it skipped WIP and never posted to your web. How will we…

565
00:50:22.225 --> 00:50:25.034
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): We know when it's leaving the warehouse.

566
00:50:27.185 --> 00:50:41.264
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): We've gone full circle! I do imagine that there are instances where things are skipped getting received, but, you know, we can't.

567
00:50:41.265 --> 00:50:42.765
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): up to it. Yeah.

568
00:50:42.765 --> 00:50:43.525
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): We know, we're.

569
00:50:43.525 --> 00:50:47.264
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Okay, I'm assuming.

570
00:50:47.265 --> 00:50:48.255
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): getting received.

571
00:50:48.255 --> 00:50:54.315
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): My question is very bundled in, but… Yeah. How do we know when it's leaving the warehouse?

572
00:50:54.315 --> 00:50:56.474
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): You have communication with your… with yourself.

573
00:50:56.480 --> 00:51:00.759
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): stage, it hits cost of the zone. Right there. Right there, right?

574
00:51:00.765 --> 00:51:06.764
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Fulfilled is when the cost is recognized when it leaves the warehouse. Yeah, like, what action do we do?

575
00:51:06.765 --> 00:51:10.505
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): There's a transaction there called item fulfillment. Oh, okay. Yeah, sorry, there's a transaction.

576
00:51:10.505 --> 00:51:13.005
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Do product coordinators are going to do that?

577
00:51:13.010 --> 00:51:15.760
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I'm gonna leave that to you, Lorenzo, I'm sorry.

578
00:51:15.765 --> 00:51:22.804
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Again, this is totally different. Yeah, it's totally different, yeah. And I need to know who's impacting my financials. I need to go find out.

579
00:51:22.810 --> 00:51:23.260
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Yeah.

580
00:51:23.265 --> 00:51:24.025
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): It is…

581
00:51:24.025 --> 00:51:31.975
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So it's a pretty quick step. Like, you go to the sales order, you hit the fulfill button, pulls up the added fulfillment, you hit… you change the status to…

582
00:51:32.405 --> 00:51:33.815
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): installed.

583
00:51:34.165 --> 00:51:36.774
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Or delivered and installed, and then you hit save.

584
00:51:37.065 --> 00:51:38.395
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): Is that some workaround of the workboard?

585
00:51:38.395 --> 00:51:39.715
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Like, why would you not?

586
00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:45.100
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So, the work… so, this is in addition to the work word. In addition. Yeah.

587
00:51:45.500 --> 00:51:46.119
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): A few more people.

588
00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:49.850
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): When we do the item fulfillment.

589
00:51:50.100 --> 00:51:56.860
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): at the same time, we want to recognize revenue, because cost and revenue recognized in the same period, right? Yes, but the…

590
00:51:56.865 --> 00:52:01.005
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): invoices, not… doing that, so there's two steps.

591
00:52:01.005 --> 00:52:07.245
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): So I'm saying that, like, when we do the invoice, I mean, item fulfillment, we have to remind ourselves to build it out.

592
00:52:07.395 --> 00:52:09.785
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): At the same time, too. Whatever is your typical.

593
00:52:09.785 --> 00:52:19.125
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): trigger for billing the customer, it can… that can stay the same, whatever that is. Because your journal entry is going to catch through.

594
00:52:19.125 --> 00:52:22.004
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): There's a journal entry to capture that part to match what the content.

595
00:52:22.005 --> 00:52:25.444
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): We were to maintain our current billing process.

596
00:52:25.575 --> 00:52:31.165
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): The customer's getting billed Prior to things getting fulfilled.

597
00:52:31.385 --> 00:52:33.085
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Because we're billing

598
00:52:33.195 --> 00:52:40.345
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): when we're done. So, things are in transit at that point, in theory, and then… how would that…

599
00:52:40.455 --> 00:52:48.465
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): how's that gonna work? Like, because then, when we build a plan, you have to recognize revenue at that point, so how are then… how are you… is it just everything's hitting WIP?

600
00:52:49.030 --> 00:52:57.000
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): No, no, so just remember, in this enterprise system and most enterprise systems, revenue and cost recognition are separate.

601
00:52:57.270 --> 00:52:58.380
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Separate things.

602
00:52:58.600 --> 00:53:17.209
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So, if you are going to initiate customer invoice before it's fulfilled, it's totally fine. So, you will have recognized revenue. And then, if for some reason you didn't do the item fulfillment before the end of that period, there'll be the report that will accrue the cost for the revenue.

603
00:53:17.215 --> 00:53:18.864
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): That was right. If I remember correctly.

604
00:53:18.870 --> 00:53:25.860
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Did, like, defer revenue? Is that the account? Yeah, but that doesn't exist.

605
00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:41.649
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Because that's the one thing I'm looking at, is literally our auditor's FASB ASC606. Revenue from contracts with customers. So that's what I'm trying to make sure that what you're telling me is in line with that, and it's…

606
00:53:42.290 --> 00:53:44.590
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): I haven't connected all the dots yet. That's okay, yeah.

607
00:53:44.590 --> 00:53:45.150
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): It's gonna take a minute.

608
00:53:45.150 --> 00:53:49.039
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yeah. But this is absolutely complying with 600.

609
00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:51.259
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): This does meet the standard. Okay, good.

610
00:53:52.410 --> 00:53:57.060
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I was always looking at how Quora and Team Design was doing, I was like, how is that, actually?

611
00:53:57.590 --> 00:54:05.580
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): With this one, we recognize Cox first, but then, you know, to make sure the revenue match with cost of food, so we book a journal entry.

612
00:54:05.870 --> 00:54:08.769
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): make sure that happens at the same. Yeah, because you guys do a little bit.

613
00:54:08.775 --> 00:54:27.835
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): different than other dealers. Most dealers don't send a customer invoice until they get… until they recognize the cost, which is fine. Like, they fulfill first, then they invoice. You guys do it early. It's fine. That's why we have this… that's why we have the cost recognition on the… on the… it accrue for revenue or accrue for cost.

614
00:54:31.205 --> 00:54:32.185
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And…

615
00:54:33.695 --> 00:54:42.704
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Well, you've worked outside of furniture before, right? Yeah, so is this a familiar… does this feel familiar to you? Because this is pretty typical for companies I've worked with outside of furniture.

616
00:54:43.790 --> 00:54:56.239
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): In manufacturing, it's the same thing. I didn't recognize cost until I actually sold it. I mean, because it would sit in inventory, and then it would hit cost… it would hit my P&O when I sold it, so I'd have a sale and a cost going.

617
00:54:56.245 --> 00:54:57.105
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): over.

618
00:54:57.110 --> 00:55:02.009
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): So it would relieve my inventory and go to the full income state. So…

619
00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:10.440
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): About 100%. I mean, it would be a part of my BOM, I think, kind of the build-up of the vendor pieces and stuff.

620
00:55:11.050 --> 00:55:14.369
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): But again, it would accumulate in inventory or WIP.

621
00:55:15.395 --> 00:55:18.974
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So, there's one other piece to this. Okay. So…

622
00:55:19.365 --> 00:55:22.545
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Most dealers I talk to, they say something like.

623
00:55:23.450 --> 00:55:25.729
Cornerstone: you have to manage WIP, or you'll go out of business.

624
00:55:26.610 --> 00:55:29.180
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And the way I interpret that is.

625
00:55:29.590 --> 00:55:38.950
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I have received inventory, but I have not been… I have not invoiced the customer yet. So I've paid for something, and I haven't gotten paid for it yet, so I am keeping an eye on that.

626
00:55:39.460 --> 00:55:51.300
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): In our system, WIP is actually not something that you really need to keep a close eye on. What you do need to keep a close eye on is inventory received, not yet invoiced, because that's the concern.

627
00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:54.520
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And then there's another account called accrued Purchases.

628
00:55:54.710 --> 00:56:07.850
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So when you do receive the product, it's gonna post to WIP, and it's gonna… the countertop's gonna be at food purchases. And this is where you can get the variances, and those variances hit food purchases. So let's just say…

629
00:56:08.030 --> 00:56:11.230
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I ordered… I had a PO for $100.

630
00:56:11.340 --> 00:56:20.309
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And then I received the product, and the value of that product that hit WIT was $100, but then I got my vendor bill, and the vendor bill was for $150.

631
00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:25.840
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So my variance here is in the… 50 bucks. The 50 bucks in the pre-purchase this price.

632
00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:32.510
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So what we've done is we have a dashboard that shows all those variances, and allows you to post

633
00:56:32.700 --> 00:56:34.439
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): those variances to COGS.

634
00:56:34.700 --> 00:56:36.029
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And to the project.

635
00:56:36.260 --> 00:56:39.619
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So it's making sure that you're truing up the costs.

636
00:56:39.770 --> 00:56:42.390
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): For the project, and then, of course, your GL.

637
00:56:42.550 --> 00:56:43.300
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): And what…

638
00:56:43.305 --> 00:56:48.704
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Action recognizes that. Is it the paying of the invoice?

639
00:56:49.550 --> 00:56:52.460
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): No, it's the vendor bill being entered into the system.

640
00:56:52.760 --> 00:56:54.360
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Does the bill itself…

641
00:56:54.760 --> 00:57:00.120
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): When the bill comes in. Yeah, because that… the bill hits accrued purchases and hits AP.

642
00:57:02.540 --> 00:57:04.340
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): What we call costs improved.

643
00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:08.409
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): etch the AP invoice to the PL, right? Yeah, our voucher.

644
00:57:08.415 --> 00:57:10.724
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I think, might be another time to have a treatment.

645
00:57:12.130 --> 00:57:12.810
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): Thank you.

646
00:57:13.820 --> 00:57:16.580
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So I know this is, like, a big… It's a big one.

647
00:57:17.030 --> 00:57:21.670
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): You know, there's 2 or 3 of these, this is a bigger one, but… It's…

648
00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:24.589
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I think you're actually gonna have a bit more visibility.

649
00:57:25.030 --> 00:57:29.770
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Than before. So, inventory received an invoice, you have a report on that.

650
00:57:29.860 --> 00:57:46.220
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): You really don't have to… WIP is… itself is less of a concern. Recruit purchases, now you have to keep an eye on, but we have a dashboard that finds all of those variances and allows you to post, a journal entry, one journal entry for all of them at one time. Is that all the personal?

651
00:57:46.360 --> 00:57:53.100
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): No, no, it doesn't have a reverse, because it's recognizing cost is really what's happening.

652
00:57:54.610 --> 00:58:01.729
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And that's for the whole system, it's not per project. So, it's like, it finds any of those variances on all of the orders.

653
00:58:03.050 --> 00:58:08.020
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And we recommend you doing that on the last day of the month, because it's really looking at anything

654
00:58:08.130 --> 00:58:14.989
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): that was recognized as a cost in that period. So you want to recognize your variances as a cost in the same period of time.

655
00:58:15.940 --> 00:58:18.349
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Can I run a general entry with you, just…

656
00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:25.469
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Again, how my brain works. So, in the scenario you said, the invoice came in for $150,

657
00:58:25.890 --> 00:58:30.919
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): AP gets credited for $150, because I've set up an invoice. Yeah.

658
00:58:31.910 --> 00:58:36.350
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): VIN gets 100, and accrued Purchases gets 50. Debit.

659
00:58:37.710 --> 00:58:44.960
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Now, let's, let's go back to the receipt. Okay. So, the receipt, let's just say that, well, the purchase order was $100,

660
00:58:45.390 --> 00:58:46.770
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): That's non-posting.

661
00:58:47.150 --> 00:58:54.800
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): The receipt comes in, and it inherits the dollar amount from the PO for $100 that is posting, so the receipt hits WIP,

662
00:58:54.940 --> 00:58:57.790
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And it hits the accrued purchases account.

663
00:59:00.600 --> 00:59:01.930
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): For $100.

664
00:59:02.140 --> 00:59:05.559
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Then the vendor bill comes in at $150.

665
00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:10.070
Cornerstone: And that hits accrued purchases, which then leaves a…

666
00:59:10.070 --> 00:59:18.710
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Imbalance of $50. And I'm sorry I'm not telling you which is credit, which is, debit, because I'm just not that smart. Well, we receive…

667
00:59:18.715 --> 00:59:20.825
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): And what he received his headache debit. Yeah.

668
00:59:20.825 --> 00:59:21.905
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): So, receiving has.

669
00:59:21.905 --> 00:59:24.534
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): GL impact. Yes, yes.

670
00:59:25.100 --> 00:59:26.369
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): So it becomes…

671
00:59:26.970 --> 00:59:29.269
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): That's, that's what hits my cough.

672
00:59:29.270 --> 00:59:30.740
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Yeah.

673
00:59:30.745 --> 00:59:36.885
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Yeah, I wish Channel was here, because I know we're supposed to receive, but I don't know if it's happening. I tracked up a lot.

674
00:59:36.890 --> 00:59:49.219
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Yeah. So, okay, so I got AP150, I got accrued Purchases Web, I got that. So now, the accrued Purchases has a remaining balance of 50 in it. Exactly.

675
00:59:49.610 --> 00:59:53.220
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): So I need to write that off to cost.

676
00:59:53.245 --> 00:59:54.314
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): That's her monthly.

677
00:59:54.725 --> 00:59:56.965
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): That's my monthly journal, that's what I was gonna say.

678
00:59:56.965 --> 01:00:02.965
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): We have a dashboard, like I said, that finds all of that, and then you hit the magic button, and boom, your email.

679
01:00:03.745 --> 01:00:04.535
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): set those will…

680
01:00:04.535 --> 01:00:06.094
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Bill posts and new wires.

681
01:00:06.725 --> 01:00:11.474
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): It will post the GL accounts and tag the projects.

682
01:00:11.475 --> 01:00:17.525
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): variances impact commission.

683
01:00:17.525 --> 01:00:18.175
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): And…

684
01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:24.070
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): when I book the invoice, the invoice is literally just revenue and AR. Yep.

685
01:00:24.350 --> 01:00:27.190
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Has nothing to do with anything on the hot section here.

686
01:00:27.195 --> 01:00:30.795
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): Why did… why did the $100 loan with PO

687
01:00:31.025 --> 01:00:37.134
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): end up being a $150 on the vendor bill. What was… what was the cause of that $50?

688
01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:39.550
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): additional free.

689
01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:42.090
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Terrorists.

690
01:00:42.805 --> 01:00:49.075
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): It's a… it's a bill, it's a discrepancy. They raised the price. Somebody missed it on the acknowledgement.

691
01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:52.770
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): have three-way batch with that scenario. We do have three.

692
01:00:52.770 --> 01:00:54.720
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): doing that. Yeah, absolutely.

693
01:00:54.725 --> 01:00:57.044
Speaker 10 (Cornerstone): And if you want to ask her about…

694
01:00:57.045 --> 01:00:57.735
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): You're the top.

695
01:00:57.735 --> 01:00:58.475
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Where?

696
01:00:58.475 --> 01:00:59.225
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): Good. Okay.

697
01:00:59.225 --> 01:00:59.965
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Thank you.

698
01:00:59.970 --> 01:01:05.490
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): You play… you play such a pivotal role.

699
01:01:05.490 --> 01:01:11.219
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): We're finding out that receiving is very important.

700
01:01:11.225 --> 01:01:12.725
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): She owned that.

701
01:01:12.725 --> 01:01:22.815
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): In which we are recognizing the cost and things are received. So, I always say, I know that we're supposed to receive and receive, but

702
01:01:23.085 --> 01:01:31.485
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Are we, and how often? We are. Yes. System, like, it's part of our process. Okay, then fine, that's all. Yeah, we do it pretty religiously every day.

703
01:01:32.245 --> 01:01:34.464
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): Anything that's sent to us?

704
01:01:34.465 --> 01:01:38.964
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): As long as the warehouse is sent, it only gets sent to us, yeah.

705
01:01:38.965 --> 01:01:44.214
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): And they pretty much have to, because that's how we track whether it's in or not. So…

706
01:01:44.215 --> 01:01:50.154
Speaker 11 (Cornerstone): We get receiving, and we receive it. It's part of the workshop.

707
01:01:50.675 --> 01:01:51.575
Speaker 11 (Cornerstone): Oh, cool.

708
01:01:51.900 --> 01:01:52.470
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Big deal.

709
01:01:52.470 --> 01:01:53.220
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): We love that business.

710
01:01:53.225 --> 01:01:58.405
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): That was, that was it. I got nervous, like… Who's gonna perform it? Is that Shauna?

711
01:02:01.330 --> 01:02:03.079
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): Can you build a PC?

712
01:02:03.305 --> 01:02:08.784
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): So, there's two parts to it. First part is receiving the product that hits with.

713
01:02:09.025 --> 01:02:17.135
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): But we have to build the items, there's a process called item fulfillment. I don't know what's it called right now in mobile.

714
01:02:17.740 --> 01:02:22.699
Speaker 11 (Cornerstone): I don't think you have any cord. Yeah, I don't think so. That's me.

715
01:02:22.705 --> 01:02:24.965
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): It's like, it's when it leaves the warehouse, right?

716
01:02:24.965 --> 01:02:27.964
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): So we confirm the ship day, or… We're not tracking that, when things.

717
01:02:27.965 --> 01:02:28.705
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): I believe, but we're.

718
01:02:28.710 --> 01:02:30.579
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): I mean, the best… The closest.

719
01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:37.700
Speaker 11 (Cornerstone): We would have the work… is the work order, and we don't… you're doing work orders, so…

720
01:02:37.705 --> 01:02:48.425
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): So, we would probably just run up against that when we go to pay the vendor, and it says, hey, this isn't fulfilled, and it's just going to be an extra step for AP, because they're going to have to go.

721
01:02:48.965 --> 01:02:56.914
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yeah, and there's a couple ways to do this, because you can fulfill in bulk, you can fulfill multiple orders at the same time. There's a couple ways to make this a little bit easier, but…

722
01:02:57.035 --> 01:03:04.034
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): just to reassure you, like, you're talking about an extra 30 seconds. You go to the sales order, you hit the fulfill button, you hit the save button, it's done.

723
01:03:04.345 --> 01:03:06.465
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Who does it in the other theories?

724
01:03:06.935 --> 01:03:10.525
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): It's different everywhere. Everybody's doing…

725
01:03:10.935 --> 01:03:20.675
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): he's doing different jobs, so I wouldn't even know where to begin to answer that question. It probably… it's probably more of an operations thing, honestly, because he's leaving the…

726
01:03:20.965 --> 01:03:22.065
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And, and somewhere.

727
01:03:22.065 --> 01:03:29.945
Speaker 11 (Cornerstone): warehouses. Some places, they have their own warehouses, so those guys, absolutely, they're doing fulfillment, because that's how they get it out their warehouses.

728
01:03:29.950 --> 01:03:40.159
Speaker 12 (Cornerstone): unique that we do not have our own warehouse, which is something we come up against in CORE all the time when we go to CoreCon. They're assuming that we have our own warehouse, and we don't.

729
01:03:42.050 --> 01:03:44.759
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): Even in third-party programs, they're not linking their.

730
01:03:44.765 --> 01:03:46.434
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Can you say that again?

731
01:03:46.435 --> 01:03:51.484
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): Sure, that's a lot. Thank you very much. That's a lot. You know how to get me.

732
01:03:51.485 --> 01:03:52.935
Speaker 12 (Cornerstone): I'll be here for a while.

733
01:03:53.490 --> 01:03:55.189
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Is there any…

734
01:03:55.890 --> 01:04:05.580
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): exposure or risk to, like, say we say that's AP's responsibility to mark things fulfilled if they're getting ready to pay a vendor and it's not done, so they have to go.

735
01:04:06.930 --> 01:04:13.370
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Is there any risk of them marking things that are fulfilled, and then we go back to find out, oh, that wasn't fulfilled? Yeah. That didn't need the warehouse.

736
01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:20.039
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Are we putting our AP people in a bad position? Because they don't possess the knowledge, they have to be the PCs.

737
01:04:20.045 --> 01:04:23.784
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): comfortable with the AP team doing that, because they don't have… No, they don't have.

738
01:04:23.785 --> 01:04:25.655
Speaker 11 (Cornerstone): I think it's…

739
01:04:25.660 --> 01:04:27.540
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): You've got the disconnect.

740
01:04:27.545 --> 01:04:29.045
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): I normally don't.

741
01:04:29.045 --> 01:04:29.785
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Everything's gonna be shady.

742
01:04:29.790 --> 01:04:44.629
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): So then AP's gonna get the invoice, they're gonna… it's gonna say, you can't pay this because it's not fulfilled, and they've gotta stop, contact the PC team. PC team's gotta find the time to go and do that. They gotta go back, communicate back to the…

743
01:04:45.410 --> 01:04:50.219
Speaker 11 (Cornerstone): Our VC team might say the PM should do it, because they're the ones who schedule the meetings, and no.

744
01:04:51.150 --> 01:04:53.520
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So you're saying you're gonna get the vendor bill.

745
01:04:53.870 --> 01:04:56.029
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): go to pay the vendor bill. AP is.

746
01:04:56.035 --> 01:04:56.745
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Maybe he does.

747
01:04:56.745 --> 01:05:01.245
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yeah, so you can enter the vendor bill without it being fulfilled.

748
01:05:01.245 --> 01:05:03.114
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): Question on that process.

749
01:05:03.120 --> 01:05:05.760
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): You can also pay it if you want to.

750
01:05:05.765 --> 01:05:06.664
Speaker 8 (Cornerstone): And you can pay them.

751
01:05:06.910 --> 01:05:09.479
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): So hold up, you can just pay. But I have a question.

752
01:05:09.485 --> 01:05:12.555
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yeah, I don't think you want to, right?

753
01:05:12.555 --> 01:05:13.985
Speaker 11 (Cornerstone): So, can we see…

754
01:05:13.985 --> 01:05:16.265
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): If an item is received.

755
01:05:16.585 --> 01:05:21.795
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): We could see it, because my previous role That one previously.

756
01:05:22.505 --> 01:05:34.104
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): It was a… it was a property management, where we can see when it's received, and then the next compare worked at… it was a renewable, where if it's not received, we can enter it, and it's…

757
01:05:34.745 --> 01:05:38.534
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): Even if it's approved, you know, until they receive it.

758
01:05:39.135 --> 01:05:44.265
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): If you can't… they can't fully approve it. And then that's when it comes up that it's fully approved.

759
01:05:44.265 --> 01:05:52.104
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): for compliance, if you're AP and you receive a vendor bill, and you're going to apply it to a receipt, and that receipt has not occurred.

760
01:05:52.285 --> 01:06:04.225
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): you're notifying who's responsible for receiving it by some warehouse or somewhere, and they have to do that transaction so that you can apply the vendor bill to that. Because typically in…

761
01:06:04.505 --> 01:06:08.815
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): For compliance, you typically don't want AP being able to

762
01:06:09.085 --> 01:06:26.375
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): receive goods in, recommend a payment, and cut a check. So you're triggered that something hasn't been done is I've got a vendor bill, but no receipt to apply it to, and then you pick up the phone and call whoever in your organization is responsible for that.

763
01:06:26.375 --> 01:06:29.294
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Well, or we can't enter it and just reroute it.

764
01:06:29.485 --> 01:06:30.025
Speaker 13 (Cornerstone): And then…

765
01:06:30.030 --> 01:06:30.769
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): As we.

766
01:06:30.770 --> 01:06:38.279
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): Most of the time you're gonna call. I mean, you're not gonna have anything to rear out, because it's just an open dealer.

767
01:06:38.285 --> 01:06:53.495
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So there's a couple ways to handle this. Their problem is the fact that their vendors are sending them a bill before they even get the product. Correct. That's the challenge. So, what you can do here, too, because you can turn this switch on in NetSuite, that it does allow you to… you can…

768
01:06:53.555 --> 01:07:04.905
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): pay a bill, or enter a bill before you got the receipt. But what I would recommend here is you enter the bill in an unapproved state, and you can't pay it in an unapproved state. It actually doesn't have GL impact.

769
01:07:04.985 --> 01:07:09.894
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): But at least it's in the system. Yes. The document's attached, it's not sitting in a drawer somewhere.

770
01:07:10.225 --> 01:07:15.225
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So, there's… that's another… that's another way to handle it. Or…

771
01:07:15.465 --> 01:07:23.605
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Maureen, you have another option here, too. Because if you want that to have a GL impact, if you don't want it to have… you don't want it to be paint yet.

772
01:07:23.725 --> 01:07:26.455
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): You can enter it in and put it on payment hold.

773
01:07:26.895 --> 01:07:31.614
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And then it does have a GLPAC, but nobody can pay it. So there's a couple ways to handle it. You have an option there.

774
01:07:32.455 --> 01:07:38.925
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I just like getting into the system, because I hate the idea of it sitting on a desk or in a drawer somewhere, waiting for someone to call me back, and…

775
01:07:39.450 --> 01:07:40.130
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): That's what happens, right?

776
01:07:40.135 --> 01:07:46.634
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): now, too, if things aren't matched up, they kind of just push into the side in emails and stuff. Yeah.

777
01:07:47.310 --> 01:07:56.530
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): I'm curious if we can enter it, put a note, and it reroutes to the person, say, the PC, and then they can see the note, and they can view, but then again, I don't think…

778
01:07:56.810 --> 01:07:57.730
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): That's it.

779
01:07:57.730 --> 01:08:05.329
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): We have an issue for that. So, we have an issue. One of the issue types is not received. Another one is price discrepancy.

780
01:08:05.470 --> 01:08:09.040
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Oh, yeah, you have a whole system to manage all of that stuff.

781
01:08:09.045 --> 01:08:09.934
Speaker 13 (Cornerstone): with the North Carolina.

782
01:08:09.935 --> 01:08:11.514
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): See it, and then… Yeah.

783
01:08:11.635 --> 01:08:18.544
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): then you can have it in the dashboard, where there are all the pending items. We're curious. We haven't gotten to the ABCs. Yep.

784
01:08:18.550 --> 01:08:24.289
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): No, no, it's all disconnected, and then those issues can get reassigned to somebody else to get them resolved.

785
01:08:25.050 --> 01:08:29.999
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): And will it escalate if they don't address it, it escalates to something?

786
01:08:30.005 --> 01:08:36.545
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yes, it can… yep, it'll be on… it'll be on some manager's dashboard, and it can turn another color if you get a little bit too long. Send it back, right?

787
01:08:37.340 --> 01:08:39.170
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): Okay.

788
01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:45.339
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Right now, in this weird process.

789
01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:49.129
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): The three of us here at this corner here do.

790
01:08:49.135 --> 01:08:51.535
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): It's gonna be happening.

791
01:08:51.535 --> 01:08:57.505
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): It's… I don't know. My title is always Whip Queen Up. Yeah.

792
01:08:57.814 --> 01:08:59.215
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): once a year.

793
01:08:59.825 --> 01:09:08.415
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Since I've been here, we clean up, we look at what's in WIP, what's been hanging out there for 2-3 years.

794
01:09:09.359 --> 01:09:11.579
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): Write it off, because I'm like, at some point.

795
01:09:11.585 --> 01:09:13.515
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): we think those projects are done.

796
01:09:14.274 --> 01:09:18.394
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): amount of money, it can be a very mature amount. Yeah, we're talking millions. Yes.

797
01:09:18.399 --> 01:09:19.199
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Who knows?

798
01:09:19.659 --> 01:09:23.369
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): So that happens in CORE.

799
01:09:24.499 --> 01:09:26.639
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Now, I'm trying to jump ahead.

800
01:09:26.645 --> 01:09:27.385
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): not in NetSu.

801
01:09:27.390 --> 01:09:33.700
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): and kind of said, because now I'm not going to have too much whip, but I might have this accrued purchase that grows.

802
01:09:33.830 --> 01:09:37.899
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): And that's now what I need to go in and clean up, right? That's right.

803
01:09:37.904 --> 01:09:53.454
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): registry on the project record that you can see all the items for each project. Okay. Or you can have a report that's global and see all the items. And it's also on the balance sheet, too, but you have visibility into all of that. But if you're doing that end of the month, it's called cost variance

804
01:09:53.614 --> 01:09:59.994
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): recognition. If you're doing that at the end of the month, that account should be pretty clean.

805
01:10:00.890 --> 01:10:01.960
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Is that a place for pickup.

806
01:10:05.180 --> 01:10:07.810
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Could be a pickup. It could be a pickup. Yeah, I hear you.

807
01:10:07.815 --> 01:10:20.324
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): This is one thing to consider, too, because if your WIP was being impacted on that time of vendor bill, not a receipt is happening earlier, then your WIP could, in theory, legitimately be larger than plus.

808
01:10:20.495 --> 01:10:22.495
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): If you're using that to borrow against.

809
01:10:25.275 --> 01:10:35.154
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): But you're taking… I mean, that item receipt means, and to some degree, like, Matt said, it depends on who you're talking to, you're taking possession of the product. Yeah, we're taking…

810
01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:42.659
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): early, right? Yup. It's waiting for the AP invoice to arrive. When we receive it, we actually have that waiting for it.

811
01:10:43.930 --> 01:10:47.379
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): I'm just doing a line of credit renegotiations.

812
01:10:47.385 --> 01:10:48.234
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Check off.

813
01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:50.000
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): I'm trying to propose to take off the.

814
01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:53.690
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): clause and lip for that… for all these reasons, and now I'm just like, nope, I know.

815
01:10:54.125 --> 01:11:05.814
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): That's for every… all the years I talk to, they're like, I want to post everything to it. I want to post… I want to post time, I want to post services, everything. Current asset.

816
01:11:05.820 --> 01:11:07.839
Speaker 14 (Cornerstone): Well, they want that to blow up.

817
01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:09.759
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I wanna… yep.

818
01:11:11.050 --> 01:11:15.079
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): That's why I asked you earlier, Dean Post, Your services do well.

819
01:11:16.590 --> 01:11:27.600
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): But that… that is one of the major reasons why… I don't know how legit it is, maybe it is, but that's one of the major reasons why other dealers do it. They're at flooding… I don't want to say inflation, but…

820
01:11:28.190 --> 01:11:30.839
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I… I can…

821
01:11:30.845 --> 01:11:34.955
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): I do not know.

822
01:11:36.110 --> 01:11:36.680
Cornerstone: Okay.

823
01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:41.700
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): This is definitely a change. This is certainly something we need to,

824
01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:50.849
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): to think through, again, the impact of, obviously our processes, especially for filling…

825
01:11:50.855 --> 01:11:52.364
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): happening. Yes, and that's where.

826
01:11:52.365 --> 01:11:58.345
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): That's our adjustment, and that's our learning and education that we need to make sure we talk about.

827
01:11:58.345 --> 01:11:59.764
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): Here's a bunch transaction.

828
01:11:59.765 --> 01:12:04.194
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): happen, you'll… It will minimize or eliminate that.

829
01:12:04.355 --> 01:12:07.365
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): Massive with adjustment at the end of the period.

830
01:12:07.370 --> 01:12:19.429
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Chris is gonna send this, white paper to you. This goes into detail on all those topics we just talked about. Thank you. Yeah, absolutely. I pulled it up when we just started talking, we didn't actually walk through, and that's fine.

831
01:12:19.540 --> 01:12:21.900
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): But it has all the topics in there.

832
01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:33.550
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And I did do a little bit of research to find out what other systems operate like this, and it's like all the other ERPs do this.

833
01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:36.520
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Now, that same revenue and cost recognition method.

834
01:12:40.090 --> 01:12:42.260
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Alright, so…

835
01:12:43.210 --> 01:12:47.779
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Let's have more conversations about this. I'm sure you're gonna have more questions, and that's… that's totally fine.

836
01:12:49.300 --> 01:12:53.250
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Let's look back… Every window.

837
01:12:54.370 --> 01:12:58.969
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): We don't know how materials for the material.

838
01:12:59.390 --> 01:13:01.090
Speaker 14 (Cornerstone): Yeah. Yeah.

839
01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:05.230
Speaker 14 (Cornerstone): Confusing is that monthly?

840
01:13:05.590 --> 01:13:06.119
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Yeah, wonderful.

841
01:13:06.125 --> 01:13:06.785
Speaker 14 (Cornerstone): account's not going to.

842
01:13:06.785 --> 01:13:13.004
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Right. I mean, it's in your key of reining it in. Like, the way we're doing it now, just balloons and balloons.

843
01:13:13.535 --> 01:13:14.515
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): But I won't…

844
01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:19.389
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): I need to investigate again what's posting and what's not, like…

845
01:13:20.350 --> 01:13:32.739
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): analyze it before we write it. We can help you with some of these processes, too, and like I said, it's a very simple step, it's just a matter of remembering, and then I can tell you, like, I don't recommend this. I have one dealer right now. Actually, they're in California, they're not.

846
01:13:32.740 --> 01:13:33.320
Speaker 14 (Cornerstone): That's hard for me.

847
01:13:33.325 --> 01:13:35.765
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): They're… they've been on NetSuite for years.

848
01:13:35.985 --> 01:13:48.925
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And they just do all the item fulfillments at the end of the month. Yeah, I don't… I don't recommend that, but they're basically, like, I just want to make sure I recognize all my costs in this accounting period.

849
01:13:49.055 --> 01:14:01.484
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And I don't trust my team to actually do… die to fulfillment, so I just do them at the end. I don't like that, because I think it actually can be a valuable part of the process, because it could also be a communication point, saying, well, this is what the warehouse, and…

850
01:14:02.175 --> 01:14:06.635
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Can trigger somebody else in the company to make sure that the work works.

851
01:14:06.785 --> 01:14:08.854
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): It's been sent out and everything, so…

852
01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:12.360
Speaker 14 (Cornerstone): I'm… I don't do more quarterly.

853
01:14:12.365 --> 01:14:15.395
Speaker 11 (Cornerstone): That's been working.

854
01:14:17.730 --> 01:14:22.890
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): I think of anything that we've seen today, this is going to be the biggest kind of thing that we need to…

855
01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:27.650
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): assess and put new processes in place. That's why I made you a white paper.

856
01:14:28.540 --> 01:14:31.929
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I woke up the other morning, yesterday morning, woke up early, and I was like.

857
01:14:32.170 --> 01:14:33.890
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I think I should put this on a white paper.

858
01:14:34.490 --> 01:14:36.060
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Marcus and I worked on it.

859
01:14:36.350 --> 01:14:44.589
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): I sent it. Sorry, I want to come from one thing. Which step hits cost of goods sold entering vendor invoices, or item fulfillment? Item fulfillment.

860
01:14:44.755 --> 01:14:46.815
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): And it leaves the warehouse. Yep.

861
01:14:46.925 --> 01:14:49.795
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): quite, that because of this song. Yep.

862
01:14:51.570 --> 01:14:53.460
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): And did you say that,

863
01:14:54.490 --> 01:14:58.820
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Fulfillment is just checking a box, or is it…

864
01:14:59.190 --> 01:15:01.059
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): When a work order is issued.

865
01:15:02.030 --> 01:15:11.109
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): that Orion looks at the date on that work order and goes, okay, it's getting pulled from the warehouse on this day, because it's installing.

866
01:15:11.115 --> 01:15:17.654
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): No, it's actually a separate transaction, and you can use this for staging the product.

867
01:15:18.005 --> 01:15:21.865
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And you can use it for picking tickets as well. Like, you can say, here's my item fulfillment.

868
01:15:22.045 --> 01:15:25.374
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): go pick all this product, here's all the VIN locations.

869
01:15:25.485 --> 01:15:38.145
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And then, once you've staged it, you can change the status to say, this is all this product that's been staged, so it can help your… the warehouse as well. Sorry, you don't have a physical warehouse, sorry, it's not gonna apply, never mind.

870
01:15:38.890 --> 01:15:39.639
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I know what you mean.

871
01:15:39.645 --> 01:15:40.405
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): Yeah, yeah, yeah.

872
01:15:40.405 --> 01:15:48.125
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): I mean, we still have… we just don't own the warehouse, but we do… we work with warehouses, so it still can help them. It could.

873
01:15:48.785 --> 01:15:55.654
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): But, like, what I would say for you guys is when you… in your communication with the warehouse, and they say.

874
01:15:56.055 --> 01:16:01.114
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): the product is left, and it's on its way to the job site. That's when I would create that fulfillment.

875
01:16:02.825 --> 01:16:05.555
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And hopefully somebody's getting that kind of communication.

876
01:16:06.135 --> 01:16:12.855
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): But if it doesn't happen right then, and then you find out two days later that they're on the site and they're working on it, just go ahead and create that film a fire, and…

877
01:16:14.490 --> 01:16:20.730
Speaker 10 (Cornerstone): Didn't get some… he did communicate with the warehouse? Get some kind of notification or anything?

878
01:16:22.770 --> 01:16:24.740
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): Sorry.

879
01:16:24.745 --> 01:16:31.514
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Do we know when things are leaving the warehouse? The answer's yes. I don't know who does? Is it you, Shana? Wendy?

880
01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:32.609
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): It would be based.

881
01:16:32.615 --> 01:16:38.245
Speaker 10 (Cornerstone): off of the poll that the PM or the account manager sent. It's literally reason.

882
01:16:38.245 --> 01:16:44.834
Speaker 15 (Cornerstone): an email to the warehouse telling them what to pull, and then on what date to pull it and deliver it. So…

883
01:16:44.835 --> 01:16:46.305
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Well, let's talk about that for a second.

884
01:16:46.545 --> 01:16:48.935
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): What does that look like? What does that poll look like?

885
01:16:49.990 --> 01:16:59.640
Speaker 15 (Cornerstone): So, all of the receiving tickets that are basically a purchase order without amounts, so it just shows quantities, it's like a pick list, those individual

886
01:16:59.850 --> 01:17:14.119
Speaker 15 (Cornerstone): ones are by vendor, and by… sometimes they circle by line, like, the items that… specifically to pull on this date are sent in bundles to the warehouse, and they say, pull all these things, deliver them to site on this date. Oh.

887
01:17:14.495 --> 01:17:18.755
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Well, what I would say is, let's use the idea of fulfillment to tell them what the goal.

888
01:17:19.535 --> 01:17:23.494
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And then you can set the date on the item fulfillment.

889
01:17:23.705 --> 01:17:25.864
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): To the date that you're telling them to deliver.

890
01:17:26.190 --> 01:17:30.379
Speaker 15 (Cornerstone): Is that, like, you have to go line by line and check a box?

891
01:17:30.540 --> 01:17:33.220
Speaker 15 (Cornerstone): For everything that you want to get pulled.

892
01:17:34.810 --> 01:17:35.930
Cornerstone: Nope.

893
01:17:37.010 --> 01:17:39.700
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I will make it easy for you. That's an offer.

894
01:17:39.705 --> 01:17:53.444
Speaker 15 (Cornerstone): I mean, I just had a big conversation with Wendy, because we have 1,000 line orders, and she might only need to send 200 of them, but they're spread across a thousand lines, so it will take her, like, 4 hours to do a pull list.

895
01:17:53.445 --> 01:18:11.155
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): No, so this is what I would do. How… so we would give you the ability to filter in the smart table down to a subset of items, because you have all… you have a filter on every row, and you can stack the filters. So then once you get down to the correct subset, you hit check all these, generate item fulfillment, and that's the…

896
01:18:11.345 --> 01:18:12.815
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Don't cancel.

897
01:18:14.825 --> 01:18:18.725
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): will trigger… fulfill. That will be the.

898
01:18:18.725 --> 01:18:21.264
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): fulfillment. Yeah, so here's two ways to do it.

899
01:18:21.625 --> 01:18:22.774
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): One's a little bit tricky.

900
01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:28.569
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): If you're saying… like, how much in advance do you need that?

901
01:18:29.110 --> 01:18:34.199
Speaker 15 (Cornerstone): You're supposed to do it at least a week in advance, it doesn't take time. So…

902
01:18:34.890 --> 01:18:43.690
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): What I would… what I would do is, I would say, okay, I'm gonna… I'm gonna go through that process, create my own fulfillment, send it on to the company, and I predate it, right?

903
01:18:43.970 --> 01:18:53.950
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I'm gonna say, today is, what is today, the 18th? And I'm gonna date… I'm gonna date my item fulfillment for the 25th, and that's gonna tell them, delivering on the 25th. Okay.

904
01:18:54.350 --> 01:18:58.549
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): My status of the fulfillment is going to be…

905
01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:06.229
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): There's 3 statuses, pick, packed, and delivered, but we're gonna rename them for you, and we're gonna say…

906
01:19:06.670 --> 01:19:08.539
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Old will be my status.

907
01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:12.789
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Poll does not have… if it's not in the final status, it doesn't have a GL impact.

908
01:19:13.170 --> 01:19:23.879
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): But I'm gonna date it for the 25th. On the 25th, when I know they're supposed to deliver, I just need confirmation that they delivered, and I'm gonna change my status to delivered, and now I'll have the JL impact.

909
01:19:26.730 --> 01:19:31.340
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Now, if you're confident that they're gonna deliver it, you could just change the status to…

910
01:19:31.580 --> 01:19:36.379
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): delivered, pre-dated for that date? Probably could. Every touch would be good.

911
01:19:36.385 --> 01:19:40.915
Speaker 15 (Cornerstone): a reversal of, like, let's say we sent 10.

912
01:19:41.075 --> 01:19:49.125
Speaker 15 (Cornerstone): they… we told them to pull it, but they missed it, and it… and then it doesn't matter, it doesn't… we're talking about bigger things, but… Yeah, you can edit that.

913
01:19:49.125 --> 01:19:49.865
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): I'm thinking…

914
01:19:49.870 --> 01:19:52.289
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): the value of fulfillment after effect. Okay. Yeah.

915
01:19:53.270 --> 01:20:02.690
Speaker 15 (Cornerstone): And then what does it look like on a warehouse site? Because I know they specifically ask for receiving tickets, so is it going to look like a receiving ticket to them? We'll make it look whatever way you want it to look, yeah.

916
01:20:03.410 --> 01:20:04.430
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yeah, bro.

917
01:20:04.690 --> 01:20:17.470
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): We can call it whatever you want, we can… because we have templates that we create for all those things. If you give us… did we already ask for receipt containments? Yeah, I'm gonna get you copies. Okay. So we can make it look the same way. I mean, like.

918
01:20:17.470 --> 01:20:19.629
Speaker 15 (Cornerstone): We even really need those?

919
01:20:19.990 --> 01:20:25.540
Speaker 15 (Cornerstone): If… because I can see people falling… doing what they do, they just send an e… write an email.

920
01:20:25.740 --> 01:20:29.559
Speaker 15 (Cornerstone): And just pull all those receiving tickets. Like, why would we need those?

921
01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:32.619
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): If we're gonna do it like this.

922
01:20:32.970 --> 01:20:36.239
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): We just want to make it look like you received a ticket. Okay.

923
01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:39.349
Speaker 15 (Cornerstone): But in the world of this new…

924
01:20:39.910 --> 01:20:45.099
Speaker 15 (Cornerstone): way. Like, do we don't actually need to issue and create receiving tickets?

925
01:20:45.560 --> 01:20:48.259
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): No, then yeah, this would replace it.

926
01:20:48.265 --> 01:20:52.694
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): I wrote down that the PC team needs to do the receiving.

927
01:20:52.985 --> 01:20:59.504
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): And now the AMs are gonna be… do the filling, because they're going to be generating this pull ticket. PMs. PMs.

928
01:21:00.455 --> 01:21:13.764
Speaker 15 (Cornerstone): Receiving tickets actually start… we do do. That's what we use when we place an order to tell the warehouse what to know to expect. So they load those into their system to say, this is what we should check off against what we pull. Right.

929
01:21:13.765 --> 01:21:18.415
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): So then when they're unloading a truck, they check, check, check, check, everything's here. Received.

930
01:21:20.340 --> 01:21:24.389
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): But I thought that AMs told the PMs what to go pick.

931
01:21:26.930 --> 01:21:27.940
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Yeah.

932
01:21:29.740 --> 01:21:44.499
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): I think we're talking about two different things. You're talking about stuff coming, being delivered by the manufacturer to the warehouse, then it's all marked received. That's the piece… And then pulled when it's time to go to the client. Right. Pulled, and that's the fulfillment part. Correct.

933
01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:46.860
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): But I… that's what I'm saying, so I…

934
01:21:47.470 --> 01:21:49.369
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Who's doing… Who's doing the second part?

935
01:21:49.370 --> 01:21:50.120
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): Performance?

936
01:21:50.125 --> 01:21:50.865
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): AMC?

937
01:21:50.870 --> 01:21:52.000
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): I think it's A.M.

938
01:21:52.000 --> 01:22:05.649
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): they're communicating that to the PMs, what they want pulled, and then the PMs are probably generating what we should be generating is a work order, because then they grab those lines, throw them onto a work order. Now it's going to be called a fulfillment, or…

939
01:22:06.060 --> 01:22:11.230
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): So it's collaborative between the AM and the PM. Am I saying that right? Yeah.

940
01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:19.400
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Yeah. Because there's somebody physically that's gonna chuck something in NetSuite. In NetSuite? That's… And that's the PM. Okay.

941
01:22:20.460 --> 01:22:26.200
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Because that person is what's generating… my costs, and…

942
01:22:27.100 --> 01:22:33.949
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): I just… That's what I'm saying, because the PM, then, is the one who's checking the box that it's been fulfilled, and that was into my.

943
01:22:33.950 --> 01:22:34.490
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): response.

944
01:22:34.495 --> 01:22:36.365
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Yeah. So it's the PM who's doing…

945
01:22:36.370 --> 01:22:39.830
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): Good fit. That's what I'm saying, that's…

946
01:22:41.080 --> 01:22:48.180
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So you can have the PM generate data fulfillment in a polled status, which shows up on your dashboard.

947
01:22:48.530 --> 01:22:55.290
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): for someone in your team to change it from poll to delivered and installed, if you want to control it. Oh, okay, oh, I see, okay.

948
01:22:55.650 --> 01:22:59.840
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Say that one more time? So the PM could create the unfulfillment.

949
01:23:00.020 --> 01:23:05.879
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Because they're going to do all the filtering down to that subset, generate the item fulfillment, the status in as pulled.

950
01:23:06.540 --> 01:23:08.630
Cornerstone: That doesn't have a GL impact yet.

951
01:23:08.820 --> 01:23:20.550
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And then that'll show up on her dashboard. Anything in that status will show up on her dashboard, and then she'll somehow validate that it was delivered and installed, and she'll change the status to delivered, installed, and

952
01:23:20.660 --> 01:23:22.560
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): then it'll have the geo-impact.

953
01:23:22.935 --> 01:23:26.094
Speaker 15 (Cornerstone): I wouldn't prevent the VM from sending that out, right?

954
01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:27.120
Speaker 14 (Cornerstone): Nope.

955
01:23:27.435 --> 01:23:30.374
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): It just, I think she wanted to control who actually had the cost.

956
01:23:31.015 --> 01:23:33.095
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Impact.

957
01:23:34.525 --> 01:23:37.354
Cornerstone: One thing I just remembered, and I think I might have misspoke.

958
01:23:38.695 --> 01:23:42.264
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): You cannot fulfill an item unless it's been received.

959
01:23:42.525 --> 01:23:43.285
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yep.

960
01:23:44.735 --> 01:23:49.595
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So, when you talked about Generating a vendor bill.

961
01:23:50.045 --> 01:23:51.545
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Early?

962
01:23:51.665 --> 01:24:01.925
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): you're gonna need to receive the product, generate the vendor bill before you… and you cannot generate a customer invoice until you… Oh, no, you can actually do it before you fulfill, sorry.

963
01:24:01.925 --> 01:24:07.204
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): That's what we could say, that it sits in an unapproved state, because there's no GL impact.

964
01:24:07.520 --> 01:24:08.150
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): Because we…

965
01:24:08.155 --> 01:24:12.195
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): can't pay it until it's received an approval. Yeah.

966
01:24:13.770 --> 01:24:15.609
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And by the way, we can… we can…

967
01:24:15.870 --> 01:24:22.480
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): flowchart all this out. Like, I want… yeah, yeah, yeah, we'll flowchart this out. I got things going everywhere.

968
01:24:22.485 --> 01:24:23.245
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Yeah, the footage chart.

969
01:24:23.245 --> 01:24:24.745
Speaker 11 (Cornerstone): Which is what he is…

970
01:24:24.745 --> 01:24:26.984
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): side of my brain looks like right now.

971
01:24:26.985 --> 01:24:30.294
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Well, we will… we'll come back and we'll flowchart all this. Okay.

972
01:24:30.300 --> 01:24:30.980
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): Right. We do…

973
01:24:30.980 --> 01:24:36.879
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): like, T-accounts. I'll leave you guys in the process, you know?

974
01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:40.900
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Cool. Alright, it's exciting.

975
01:24:41.210 --> 01:24:42.030
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Okay.

976
01:24:42.610 --> 01:24:55.789
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Well, let's then jump on to project accounting, and I think, actually, we've talked a little bit around this. The only thing I really needed to know from you was, do you want services to post to WIP? The answer is no.

977
01:24:55.990 --> 01:25:00.010
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Do you want your internal time to post to the GL?

978
01:25:01.510 --> 01:25:04.219
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Love it. As the self comes. We have right now.

979
01:25:04.225 --> 01:25:05.225
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): honest. Yeah.

980
01:25:05.225 --> 01:25:14.785
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): The sell side, which is intense… the sell side is what posts the GL, and that's not the actual time. Times, cost, and that gets posted via payroll. Yep.

981
01:25:15.480 --> 01:25:22.719
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yeah, we had some dealers who say, no, we wanted to post to the GL, once the payroll comes, we want it to be there. There's this diff… difference…

982
01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:27.180
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): everybody have time to enter it every month on time, that's all. Exactly.

983
01:25:27.185 --> 01:25:27.945
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): disparate.

984
01:25:28.115 --> 01:25:29.635
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Okay,

985
01:25:30.635 --> 01:25:42.875
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): vendor and accounts payable management. There's… we already kind of touched on this because of, really, the two things I always bring up here is the unapproved state or the payment volt state. It really all comes down to

986
01:25:43.065 --> 01:25:46.974
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Do you want that to have a GL impact, or not?

987
01:25:47.205 --> 01:25:59.204
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I tend to say, let me… because this is going to end up becoming something I'm going to have to pay, let me have it… have a GL impact, that way my AP is pretty accurate, even though it might not be perfect.

988
01:25:59.465 --> 01:26:03.284
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Rather than it not being there, so I usually put them on payment hold, but it's up to you.

989
01:26:03.575 --> 01:26:04.715
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): They want to do that.

990
01:26:05.415 --> 01:26:08.694
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): That's the consideration. Payment hold has no impact to the…

991
01:26:08.700 --> 01:26:10.560
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): AP… No, payment holder.

992
01:26:10.565 --> 01:26:13.114
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Gotcha. Unapproved and unapproved.

993
01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:15.040
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): It does not join that.

994
01:26:15.315 --> 01:26:23.014
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So, but my thought is, okay, let's just say I get a bill for $5,000, and there's a discrepancy on there, and the discrepancy might be $500. Well.

995
01:26:23.285 --> 01:26:28.915
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): When I look at my cash flow forecast and I'm considering my AP, I'd rather see the $5,000 than nothing.

996
01:26:29.755 --> 01:26:31.875
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Well, that's why I tend to do that.

997
01:26:31.875 --> 01:26:35.465
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): And right now, we don't enter it, so it sits outside of…

998
01:26:35.470 --> 01:26:36.360
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): imaging.

999
01:26:36.840 --> 01:26:41.110
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I remember when I let somebody on my accounting team go, and

1000
01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:52.060
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So somebody else was cleaning out their desk? They came in with a stack of invoices. I was like, where was this? Oh, it was in their drawer. What is it? Oh, there was just discrepancies, and they didn't…

1001
01:26:52.065 --> 01:26:55.825
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Before electronics, the search for unrecorded liability was over drawers.

1002
01:26:55.825 --> 01:26:56.565
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): outstanding.

1003
01:26:56.570 --> 01:26:57.320
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): P, and look…

1004
01:26:57.325 --> 01:26:58.064
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): or something like that.

1005
01:26:58.070 --> 01:26:59.560
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): 500,000. Oh, okay.

1006
01:26:59.565 --> 01:27:01.824
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I'll never do that again, everything goes in the system.

1007
01:27:01.825 --> 01:27:09.735
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Yeah. No, and Guada and Michael have been really good about trying to automate as much as they can, let stuff just come through so that there is no human

1008
01:27:09.945 --> 01:27:12.365
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): inter… interaction there and stuff, so…

1009
01:27:12.365 --> 01:27:15.405
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): We crude, too. If it's not entered, we accrued.

1010
01:27:15.545 --> 01:27:19.765
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): At the end of the month. Oh, okay, okay. Do you do any AP automation?

1011
01:27:21.460 --> 01:27:24.419
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): I don't right now. Okay.

1012
01:27:25.090 --> 01:27:27.230
Speaker 13 (Cornerstone): You wanna hear more about that?

1013
01:27:27.235 --> 01:27:28.645
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): Just so I can kind of…

1014
01:27:29.290 --> 01:27:40.169
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): AP automation? Yeah, AP automation. I mean, I would say the one thing that we do use that I would say, as long to mention, is Core has the OCR module where you can

1015
01:27:40.410 --> 01:27:43.989
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Got a list of, what is it, 10 or 12 vendors now?

1016
01:27:44.260 --> 01:27:51.790
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): You just pick the vendor and grab a invoice or a batch of invoices, load them, it does OCR, and populates those.

1017
01:27:51.795 --> 01:27:54.144
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So it works out in the line level for you?

1018
01:27:54.395 --> 01:27:58.145
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yeah. It does. Okay, so… so… So, yeah.

1019
01:27:58.150 --> 01:27:58.879
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): I wish Kara Zank.

1020
01:27:58.880 --> 01:28:06.919
Speaker 7 (Cornerstone): Okay, because I wanted to see if I could see it, like, okay, does it upload there to kind of, like, or it would have a PDF? Yeah.

1021
01:28:06.920 --> 01:28:09.790
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): So that's how we're doing it now, I don't know how.

1022
01:28:09.795 --> 01:28:12.944
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yeah, so, and that's part of the price support.

1023
01:28:13.555 --> 01:28:29.925
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Or is that an additional cost? How much part of it. Okay. So, NetSuite has a tool for doing some of this AP automation that's kind of pricey. There's probably 10 other third-party tools, suite apps, that do the same thing. Avanto does some of that as well. We tried them, didn't work.

1024
01:28:29.925 --> 01:28:36.314
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Did work? Okay. I mean, it was a while ago, and, you know, they've… We just replaced it.

1025
01:28:36.315 --> 01:28:40.424
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): revisited them again. It doesn't look like it's a solution for us.

1026
01:28:41.175 --> 01:28:47.785
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So, the only thing I'll say, though, here is that any solution with that's what it's going to cost leads additional costs in. So.

1027
01:28:49.980 --> 01:28:52.720
Speaker 9 (Cornerstone): I don't like that.

1028
01:28:52.725 --> 01:28:56.354
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): bill catcher, because it's so expensive, but, Square Works has a really nice.

1029
01:28:56.525 --> 01:28:58.515
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): That is still so comfortable.

1030
01:28:58.635 --> 01:29:01.704
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): bill.com is pretty good, a little pricey, but good.

1031
01:29:01.705 --> 01:29:07.224
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): you scan through, and then it reads the invoice, populate all the numbers, names… How does that, like, links off?

1032
01:29:07.930 --> 01:29:25.279
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I'm not sure about that one, I haven't heard about that one, but there's a couple that are specific to it. Let's, let's make a note to get a SquareWorks demo, people can understand that. And then, Kip, for that, for what you have with Core, is that a manual? You take this PDF, put it in our reset monitoring the inbox? Manual. Okay, we didn't look at…

1033
01:29:26.860 --> 01:29:31.479
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So, this one is a little bit… a little bit easier, because it monitors it in Vox. We do have.

1034
01:29:31.505 --> 01:29:33.924
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): I have… I have a… I don't know.

1035
01:29:34.385 --> 01:29:52.165
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): automation set up on the AP mailbox, where it looks at it, and it'll strip off PDFs and throw them into single folder. It's just saving them one little step. It strips off the PDF, dumps it into a folder, moves that email into red, and so it just declutters their inbox. It kind of consolidates all the PDFs. Okay.

1036
01:29:53.050 --> 01:29:57.999
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I don't think there's anything else around project accounting to get revenue and cost recognition, vendor accounts payable management.

1037
01:29:58.005 --> 01:30:04.104
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): The only thing I want to talk about project accounting is… That, the ability to

1038
01:30:04.375 --> 01:30:08.874
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): generate a P&L by customer, or project.

1039
01:30:08.875 --> 01:30:10.375
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): By project? Yeah. Yeah.

1040
01:30:10.750 --> 01:30:19.459
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Because, again, these two gentlemen have had to do a lot of hula hoops to try to compile stuff to show things like that, and I don't know if that's now…

1041
01:30:20.350 --> 01:30:25.370
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): So, I think in the customer profile, it has the revenue and cost.

1042
01:30:26.020 --> 01:30:31.580
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): And then you can set a time frame to look at how profitable they are.

1043
01:30:31.580 --> 01:30:35.870
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Oh, as a customer, yeah. Yeah, yeah, custom. Of a project.

1044
01:30:36.550 --> 01:30:38.520
Speaker 14 (Cornerstone): Oh, sorry.

1045
01:30:38.525 --> 01:30:41.034
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Well, let me get to read.

1046
01:30:41.660 --> 01:30:45.909
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Well, I guess, actually, I was wondering… you're talking about project first, right?

1047
01:30:46.600 --> 01:30:47.720
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Projects.

1048
01:30:47.860 --> 01:30:50.660
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): that roll up onto clients. Okay.

1049
01:30:51.660 --> 01:30:58.880
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So we give you… we give you profitability visibility on the project record, but really it's… it's GP.

1050
01:30:59.280 --> 01:31:05.879
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So… That's fine. Okay, so when you say income statement, I'm also thinking, like, if you're gonna do some type of allocations across expenses…

1051
01:31:05.885 --> 01:31:06.634
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): And we did do that.

1052
01:31:06.635 --> 01:31:18.374
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): that. I mean, we assigned, but then, again, it was on just purely an Excel spreadsheet at 15% whatever, you know, to get to an estimated income. But we had… we had…

1053
01:31:19.265 --> 01:31:23.705
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): sales costs from those projects, and then we.

1054
01:31:23.710 --> 01:31:31.779
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Okay. So, GP by project, yes, GP by customer, yes. Okay. But not net profit. Perfect. Okay. No, that's good. Yep.

1055
01:31:32.180 --> 01:31:37.589
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And we do the variation, too. Commissioner GP and Project GP, and then we do master GP.

1056
01:31:38.200 --> 01:31:45.929
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Perfect. And then on the flip side, we also did one of trying to understand the profitability.

1057
01:31:48.840 --> 01:31:51.829
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): That type of stuff.

1058
01:31:51.835 --> 01:31:52.805
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): We've been out of kin.

1059
01:31:52.915 --> 01:31:58.055
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Those are pretty easy reports to produce. The only question… well, just tell me what you want to see.

1060
01:31:58.355 --> 01:32:02.244
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Like, total purchases a lifetime by vendor.

1061
01:32:02.250 --> 01:32:20.469
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): I mean, again, because there was so much gyration that needed to be done, we did 5 years back. Yeah. You know, we're just kind of looking at the last 5 years cumulative. Yep. And then, actually, I think we had to break it out for Mark, right? Let me broke it up by year. So, just again, our CEO wanted to see how

1062
01:32:20.470 --> 01:32:23.960
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): How we were spending by vendor, and… and how we do federal.

1063
01:32:23.965 --> 01:32:32.365
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Okay, so sell cost to GP by vendor. Yeah. Yeah, that's not a problem. Okay. Sometimes it's, you won't have the… you won't have the historical data.

1064
01:32:32.535 --> 01:32:34.735
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): We can give you current data.

1065
01:32:34.735 --> 01:32:39.284
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): I get a lot of, like, I just did one right before we came in here,

1066
01:32:39.745 --> 01:32:49.165
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): there's no way to look at a project profitability in court that I've ever found, so I have to create the… I have to create this crazy Excel sheet.

1067
01:32:49.535 --> 01:33:01.984
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): So that would be nice, if we could just run a report that would show us vendor profitability, and the one I created breaks down by category, by order number, it just shows you just the different things, how much time did we spend, all these things.

1068
01:33:02.165 --> 01:33:05.954
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): That is really common, and then another thing that's really common is, like.

1069
01:33:06.355 --> 01:33:17.524
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): marketing will come to me and say, I want to know how much business we did with… in healthcare from this period to this period. I can't.

1070
01:33:17.525 --> 01:33:28.615
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): all that from Core. So that one we actually have as a custom statement, which means you can go to the income statement, and you can say, give me an income statement by vertical market. Nice. So you have a lot of visibility on that one.

1071
01:33:29.945 --> 01:33:32.944
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yeah, and then the only question, again, is, like.

1072
01:33:33.375 --> 01:33:40.224
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): how accurate is that below the GP line? Because all the expenses and allocations and things to consider there, but

1073
01:33:40.525 --> 01:33:44.065
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yeah, you for sure get it by with your revenue and GP.

1074
01:33:45.270 --> 01:33:47.179
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): And not on our clients?

1075
01:33:47.580 --> 01:33:48.460
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Hey, Pete.

1076
01:33:50.010 --> 01:34:00.529
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): just reports that I'm asked to run, just in general from different departments that I can't get at. Well, the thing that we bop up against a lot with CORE

1077
01:34:00.740 --> 01:34:06.099
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): And I'm hoping this solves is there are all, you know, hundreds of fields in core, but…

1078
01:34:06.350 --> 01:34:12.370
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): A lot of times, I'll go in and run a report, and 75% of those fields aren't available to me to use as a.

1079
01:38:45.100 --> 01:38:46.630
Marcus Dallacqua: Hi, we're trying to fix it.

1080
01:38:48.140 --> 01:38:49.880
Marcus Dallacqua: They said for a month. Okay.

1081
01:38:53.180 --> 01:38:57.750
Marcus Dallacqua: I don't think she can hear you.

1082
01:39:06.040 --> 01:39:10.639
Marcus Dallacqua: So, at best, yes. It's just, obviously, it's a very manual process.

1083
01:39:11.230 --> 01:39:12.789
Marcus Dallacqua: It's a lot of maintenance.

1084
01:39:13.070 --> 01:39:29.429
Marcus Dallacqua: And it's a lot of manipulation… Yeah. …to get stuff in there, and what they want to see, and how they want to see it, and blah blah blah. So, I guess there's not, I think, one strategy for all… they're all over the world. Swiss Army Knife, right? Yeah. So let's schedule a session.

1085
01:39:29.720 --> 01:39:32.299
Marcus Dallacqua: to walk through all of that? Yeah.

1086
01:39:32.450 --> 01:39:36.889
Marcus Dallacqua: I'll get, when to… to give you the list.

1087
01:39:37.650 --> 01:39:47.780
Marcus Dallacqua: Is that inside the financial management process area, or is that something else? No, it's within my AR team. Okay. So when, who we're trying to connect, she's the one who manages that. Okay.

1088
01:39:48.990 --> 01:39:53.480
Marcus Dallacqua: So we'll get that scheduled. I think she can hear you guys know? She says we are back.

1089
01:39:53.680 --> 01:39:56.509
Marcus Dallacqua: I turned my mic on, I think that might be why, yeah.

1090
01:39:57.870 --> 01:40:00.760
Marcus Dallacqua: I have keywords not working.

1091
01:40:01.640 --> 01:40:03.040
Uyen Dang: I could hear you guy now.

1092
01:40:05.120 --> 01:40:06.170
Marcus Dallacqua: Hi, Wynne!

1093
01:40:06.170 --> 01:40:12.559
Uyen Dang: Hi. Market… Michael and I had an issue. We didn't hear you guys, but I could hear you now. I don't know about Michael.

1094
01:40:12.860 --> 01:40:14.670
Michael Salvador: There is a… I can hear you there now.

1095
01:40:14.670 --> 01:40:17.089
Marcus Dallacqua: Oh my goodness, okay, great. So…

1096
01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:23.320
Marcus Dallacqua: While we were down, we were talking about all the portals that you're using to…

1097
01:40:26.680 --> 01:40:28.139
Uyen Dang: Now I can't hear.

1098
01:40:30.340 --> 01:40:32.139
Uyen Dang: Michael, can you hear Michael?

1099
01:40:32.140 --> 01:40:33.729
Michael Salvador: No, no, no, I think Jason…

1100
01:40:33.730 --> 01:40:34.230
Cornerstone: Can you hear me?

1101
01:40:34.230 --> 01:40:35.579
Uyen Dang: There we go, yes.

1102
01:40:35.580 --> 01:40:37.010
Michael Salvador: Yeah.

1103
01:40:37.010 --> 01:40:40.400
Cornerstone: Okay, so once again, so while you… we were down.

1104
01:40:40.403 --> 01:40:46.182
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): I was talking to the team about all of the portals that you are using for your clients to.

1105
01:40:46.192 --> 01:40:49.362
Cornerstone: Set up for invoices.

1106
01:40:49.368 --> 01:40:51.487
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Fays and payment, and things like that.

1107
01:40:51.730 --> 01:40:52.150
Uyen Dang: Yes.

1108
01:40:52.150 --> 01:40:57.009
Cornerstone: So, can you send me the email that we have all of.

1109
01:40:57.018 --> 01:41:00.198
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): go and list it out, and then I'll send it to them today.

1110
01:41:00.200 --> 01:41:02.139
Uyen Dang: Yes, I'll make a list.

1111
01:41:02.400 --> 01:41:09.250
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Thank you. But, like, I watch people…

1112
01:41:09.250 --> 01:41:13.639
Cornerstone: Go fixing the volume bar right here. On the laptop. Go audio that little carrot.

1113
01:41:14.870 --> 01:41:15.930
Cornerstone: the computer.

1114
01:41:22.210 --> 01:41:36.329
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): All right, so that was… that was the one last thing. So, yeah, again, I don't think it's a one-fit-all strategy, because they're all different, and they all require different things, so I just, again, was curious if there's any that talk to nuts.

1115
01:41:36.680 --> 01:41:43.709
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): There could be, but it might be, one of those things where, well, with the one, we're planning on doing, like, just grab…

1116
01:41:43.710 --> 01:41:44.149
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Send us the email.

1117
01:41:44.150 --> 01:41:48.939
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): email and turn it into an order. Yeah. That's… like, if we create that solution.

1118
01:41:49.530 --> 01:41:58.030
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): That could fit all eight. Correct. Right? Yeah. So, but then that's just one piece of the communication. There's other pieces, right? But maybe we… maybe that's a good place to start. Yeah.

1119
01:41:58.130 --> 01:41:58.969
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So, I'll send you the.

1120
01:41:58.975 --> 01:42:00.445
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Phyllis once such a.

1121
01:42:00.675 --> 01:42:03.675
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Right, and then we'll set up another session, we'll talk through all that.

1122
01:42:04.045 --> 01:42:06.025
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): We already talked about expense management.

1123
01:42:06.125 --> 01:42:19.494
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Specify, we're gonna… we're getting you the PDF of that. Actually, comparison. So I got both. Amazing. Asset management, we're gonna get you a demo on fixed asset management. Okay. We have that.

1124
01:42:20.045 --> 01:42:23.864
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Financial reporting, we kind of talked a bit about that. Any other…

1125
01:42:24.145 --> 01:42:28.365
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): And business intelligence, we actually have a whole other session tomorrow, but any other financial reporting?

1126
01:42:28.495 --> 01:42:29.375
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Please tell me, I'm.

1127
01:42:29.375 --> 01:42:30.374
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): my cash flow.

1128
01:42:30.655 --> 01:42:31.924
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): cash flow statement.

1129
01:42:31.925 --> 01:42:39.275
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): You have a cash flow payment, and you have a cash flow dashboard. Cash flow365. So…

1130
01:42:39.535 --> 01:42:45.394
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): The only thing I wish about the dashboard is that they would let us input Things like pro forma.

1131
01:42:45.835 --> 01:42:48.424
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): But they don't, but… The dashboard, that's…

1132
01:42:48.425 --> 01:42:51.054
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): kidding, I'd be so happy, but so excited.

1133
01:42:52.375 --> 01:43:10.264
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): And then… so we did… I think our… the stock reports that you generate from NetSuite are gonna be night and day different from what we have, because everything… we can't use anything out of… out of 4 right now. We have to download it into Excel, and create it, and do variances and percent changes, and things like that.

1134
01:43:10.265 --> 01:43:14.004
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): stock reports? Oh, you mean the standard reports? Standard reports. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

1135
01:43:14.575 --> 01:43:18.505
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): So hopefully I'm looking forward to seeing all the… all the NetSuite reports.

1136
01:43:18.505 --> 01:43:29.824
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yeah, like, here's a great example, the income statement. NetSuite has a great income statement, it's the… it's agile, and do all the dimensioning. I always edit it, and I add percent of revenue as a column immediately.

1137
01:43:29.975 --> 01:43:41.350
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So those are all easily customizable. Perfect, yeah. So we can customize our own management, too. We want revenue by employee, we want, like, a percentage of revenue for other cars.

1138
01:43:41.540 --> 01:43:44.760
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): You're probably gonna do that using a safe search. Okay.

1139
01:43:45.150 --> 01:43:48.509
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Which is a… which is another tool, another reporting tool, but…

1140
01:43:48.950 --> 01:43:52.030
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): The… okay, so here's another thing to think about.

1141
01:43:52.580 --> 01:43:57.990
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): NetSuite Reports does a really good job of reporting as of.

1142
01:43:59.310 --> 01:44:02.980
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So, like, I can run a balance sheet as of a certain date.

1143
01:44:03.850 --> 01:44:07.349
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): NetSuite Safe Searches are always dynamic.

1144
01:44:07.670 --> 01:44:15.379
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Like, you can kind of twist them and turn them to be kind of… do that as-of reporting, but it's really tricky, but it's… they're typically dynamic.

1145
01:44:15.510 --> 01:44:18.890
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So… We… we'll have to think through…

1146
01:44:19.250 --> 01:44:28.999
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): what reports you're looking for, and which tool is going to be the best tool. We actually have a couple other tools that are available to us as well, like PQL and things like that, but…

1147
01:44:29.620 --> 01:44:34.670
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Do you have any critical reports, though, that are outside of the norm? We want to know about significantly after that.

1148
01:44:35.480 --> 01:44:46.099
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): First, they just, again, getting in cash flow would be amazing. Okay. And I know we talked about this the other day, but we do a lot of stuff with headcount.

1149
01:44:46.500 --> 01:45:01.370
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): And Matt said, you know, we'll keep you doing that in Paylocity. I guess that that's the maintenance stuff, but for us, I don't… Paylocity's also dynamic, so it doesn't stay at that point in time, which we try to capture

1150
01:45:01.710 --> 01:45:08.290
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): on July of this year, we had 85 headcount, and then next year, you know what I mean? Because we try to keep…

1151
01:45:08.410 --> 01:45:11.969
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): We try to do variances on the number of heads and things like that.

1152
01:45:11.970 --> 01:45:13.010
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): So…

1153
01:45:13.650 --> 01:45:19.330
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Is there a way for us to populate a data, like, collected data?

1154
01:45:20.210 --> 01:45:23.970
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): metric somewhere, and… And populate that?

1155
01:45:25.110 --> 01:45:26.849
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So, you, like…

1156
01:45:27.080 --> 01:45:35.939
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): you can use the saved search to do some of the as-of date. Like, I can say, how many employees did we have as of July the month?

1157
01:45:36.930 --> 01:45:40.059
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): You can do that. And then you can say, how many employees did I have?

1158
01:45:40.640 --> 01:45:44.600
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): that were inactive as of July 1, and you can get some of that.

1159
01:45:44.910 --> 01:45:50.800
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): It's just when you start to get more complicated than that, it gets really hard with the safe search, and we have to use some other tools.

1160
01:45:50.805 --> 01:45:59.824
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): And again, we're doing all that in Excel. Same thing with the number of work days. Again, it's just a static number, but it impacts the way we do.

1161
01:45:59.825 --> 01:46:01.694
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): calculations and KPIs, all these things.

1162
01:46:01.700 --> 01:46:10.619
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): that, and if I can capture that in there, obviously, at that point, I'd love to. Again, we're doing all that in Excel right now, so just trying to see if there's some…

1163
01:46:10.810 --> 01:46:12.450
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): some alternate…

1164
01:46:13.350 --> 01:46:15.290
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): data thing that I can populate.

1165
01:46:15.580 --> 01:46:16.070
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): book.

1166
01:46:16.075 --> 01:46:21.675
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): we implemented Power BI, and it just was connected to NetSuite, and that information was connected.

1167
01:46:21.680 --> 01:46:25.070
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): connected to velocity, it would just do that for you. Correct.

1168
01:46:25.075 --> 01:46:28.935
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): but it's dynamic. I want it to be static, so that I can close a period.

1169
01:46:28.935 --> 01:46:32.885
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): to know that I closed with 30 days, and…

1170
01:46:33.015 --> 01:46:37.084
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): 85 headcount on that period of close, and it didn't change.

1171
01:46:38.880 --> 01:46:41.009
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Now we have to upload list numbers.

1172
01:46:41.010 --> 01:46:49.810
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): No, you don't have to upload them, that's the point of Power BI, is that it's connected, it's just there. I would imagine you would just put in a date parameter to get the information as of those dates.

1173
01:46:55.480 --> 01:46:59.079
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): But also, I'm like, it's a month-to-month for people count, like.

1174
01:46:59.360 --> 01:47:01.170
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): How perfect does that need to be?

1175
01:47:01.340 --> 01:47:07.000
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): It's really just a… Pulse check. It's not a financial…

1176
01:47:07.490 --> 01:47:10.249
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): I don't know, but there's things that I'm trying… again, I'm just trying to see what.

1177
01:47:10.250 --> 01:47:11.139
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): what's doable.

1178
01:47:11.145 --> 01:47:13.935
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): And I've had data fields.

1179
01:47:13.940 --> 01:47:21.380
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): that don't… are not GL-related, but that you can populate stuff before. So I just, again, trying to see if we can do that.

1180
01:47:21.380 --> 01:47:26.179
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yeah, so there's a couple ways to handle that, if you need that as-of information.

1181
01:47:26.740 --> 01:47:29.460
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So, like, we can easily create a custom record

1182
01:47:29.700 --> 01:47:35.039
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): That, at the end of the month, it writes that information to the customer record. It's a snapshot, basically it is what it is.

1183
01:47:35.390 --> 01:47:36.330
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Pretty simple.

1184
01:47:40.780 --> 01:47:43.730
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): All depends on what's most important.

1185
01:47:43.920 --> 01:47:45.140
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Phase 1.

1186
01:47:45.660 --> 01:47:47.989
Cornerstone: I imagine you're gonna… you have a lot of this stuff.

1187
01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:52.300
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): with the end goal of absolutely an element as much as possible. Oh, yeah, yeah, no, again.

1188
01:47:52.645 --> 01:47:55.674
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): This is the stuff we do outside of it, so…

1189
01:47:56.815 --> 01:47:58.905
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Not for Phase 1 at all.

1190
01:47:59.650 --> 01:48:04.679
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): I do want to say, though, you know, I know we're early on Day 2, but you guys are not an overly complicated

1191
01:48:05.250 --> 01:48:14.900
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): In the show. Come tell them that. No, I don't think it was… yeah, no, it wasn't meant to be, like… like, you guys are simple, you guys are very organized.

1192
01:48:14.905 --> 01:48:17.905
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): I don't want them to think that they can get more complicated, is what I meant by it.

1193
01:48:17.905 --> 01:48:35.695
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yeah, no, no, you guys, like, you have… you're process-oriented, you're organized, you're… you're rational thinkers, yeah. You're very organized. Accurate. Well, well, and you're process-driven, so that… those are all, like, for us, those are, like, really good signs. Those are… you guys are easy customers to work with.

1194
01:48:35.855 --> 01:48:36.625
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): the world.

1195
01:48:36.625 --> 01:48:41.015
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): The goal is learn the process so that when you break it, you know what you're breaking.

1196
01:48:42.530 --> 01:48:44.110
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So, yeah.

1197
01:48:45.060 --> 01:48:53.359
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): That brings us to the end. Anything else? Then you'll do fine with NetSuite, because that's… that conflict is typically the hardest one to resolve.

1198
01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:56.480
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): And you're not processed thinking, because NetSuite's gonna…

1199
01:48:57.860 --> 01:49:01.080
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): force you down the path for emphasis. Yeah.

1200
01:49:02.450 --> 01:49:08.940
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): what Matt just said is what I want to dive hard on. That last one, is now being able to use Power BI and all that to do…

1201
01:49:09.060 --> 01:49:10.330
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): are reporting.

1202
01:49:12.280 --> 01:49:19.170
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): be able to do that. Yeah, so the question then is, what information do you want? How do you get it out? Where do you want to put it?

1203
01:49:19.310 --> 01:49:21.940
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): That's… those are the questions, so…

1204
01:49:22.090 --> 01:49:25.689
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): We would like to get a… we'd like to get a crack at solving whatever

1205
01:49:25.820 --> 01:49:32.340
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): reporting issues that you have inside of NetSuite, but if you really want to use Power BI, we're not going to stop you. There are

1206
01:49:32.560 --> 01:49:41.629
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): integrations with Power BI, and then maybe even a cheaper way to go is just tell us what you need, we can exp… we can automatically export the information out for you. I think you just…

1207
01:49:41.635 --> 01:49:44.015
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Send him a… bumped.

1208
01:49:44.465 --> 01:49:45.205
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Yeah.

1209
01:49:45.775 --> 01:49:55.365
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Okay. With that whole document package. So we have… This is a big Excel spreadsheet we have right now. It looks like Power BI dashboard.

1210
01:49:55.365 --> 01:49:57.604
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Yeah. Looks like it.

1211
01:49:57.605 --> 01:50:01.365
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Power BI, and then they, they faked me, they deepfaked me. I feel something like…

1212
01:50:01.365 --> 01:50:02.105
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): and dashboard.

1213
01:50:02.110 --> 01:50:10.850
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Nice, yeah. I was like, why is this a PDF? Well… I know we're going to, like, NetSuite, so I'm not gonna build something new, and then we're going to the.

1214
01:50:10.850 --> 01:50:12.670
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Yes, we already have the dashboards.

1215
01:50:12.670 --> 01:50:13.250
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Yep.

1216
01:50:13.850 --> 01:50:18.839
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): The only thing with Power BI, and I like Power BI, I'm used to it, the only thing to think about is…

1217
01:50:19.390 --> 01:50:28.289
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): the data has to be stored somewhere. Yeah. So you gotta get it out, you gotta store it somewhere, and then you, you know, you write the Power BI on top of it. So where are you gonna put it?

1218
01:50:28.640 --> 01:50:33.470
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Is that… what type of database is that? Is it a SQL database? Is it a JSON database?

1219
01:50:33.640 --> 01:50:36.020
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): So there's some planning that needs to go into it.

1220
01:50:39.230 --> 01:50:41.670
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): It's not like that. As soon as you get out of the system, it's aging.

1221
01:50:42.090 --> 01:50:49.440
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): I think the point of it was that it was supposed to be live. You, like, keep connecting and refreshing, but…

1222
01:50:49.445 --> 01:50:57.325
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Yeah, you need to refresh it, because I think you need to build a dashboard, and then you connect a Power BI dashboard to NetSuite, and then you have to refresh it.

1223
01:50:57.330 --> 01:50:59.709
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): We eventually did an outlook.

1224
01:50:59.945 --> 01:51:04.934
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): So besides the KPI and the closeout document, what else?

1225
01:51:05.415 --> 01:51:09.765
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Because my original was, like, I wanted to build out a bunch of stuff because of core.

1226
01:51:10.175 --> 01:51:16.045
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): But all of that's just standard in that suite, so besides the KPIs for finance and for the month-end.

1227
01:51:16.195 --> 01:51:20.105
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): What would we need to put at Power BI at this point? We can do multi-push.

1228
01:51:20.110 --> 01:51:25.180
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): report at Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3, Tier 4… I think they can do that.

1229
01:51:25.180 --> 01:51:25.940
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): pounds.

1230
01:51:25.940 --> 01:51:33.649
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): No, and that's the thing, we need to see all the core stand… see, not the core… the standard reports that come with NetSuite and…

1231
01:51:34.220 --> 01:51:38.089
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): And what we can just use in our dashboards. Yeah, okay.

1232
01:51:39.750 --> 01:51:42.350
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): Yeah, the legacy system being caucus.

1233
01:51:43.090 --> 01:51:48.850
Speaker 5 (Cornerstone): It messes with life. Exactly. It just messes with life.

1234
01:51:49.490 --> 01:51:57.210
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): All right, very good. Well, good session. Thank you. We'll definitely have a couple more discussions, but we got… we got pretty far down the rabbit hole. It's good.

1235
01:51:57.340 --> 01:51:58.200
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Alright.

1236
01:51:58.430 --> 01:51:58.950
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Two years ago.

1237
01:51:58.955 --> 01:52:01.974
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Good morning. All right, thank you.

1238
01:52:01.975 --> 01:52:02.815
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Thank you very much.

1239
01:52:02.820 --> 01:52:03.850
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Don't forget to launch Twitter.

1240
01:52:03.850 --> 01:52:05.330
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): You're here for lunch. Well, I'm gonna do the.

1241
01:52:05.330 --> 01:52:07.950
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Matt, would you set up…

1242
01:52:07.955 --> 01:52:10.975
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): theological is fighting.

1243
01:52:10.975 --> 01:52:12.845
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): If you can't come in, let me know.

1244
01:52:12.850 --> 01:52:14.710
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Okay. Yeah.

1245
01:52:14.715 --> 01:52:15.725
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Hell yeah.

1246
01:52:16.215 --> 01:52:17.714
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Most of those cells are in custody.

1247
01:52:17.715 --> 01:52:19.974
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): You're busy.

1248
01:52:19.975 --> 01:52:23.285
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): Similar to babysitters needed babysitters? That's what I was talking about.

1249
01:52:23.285 --> 01:52:23.845
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Right.

1250
01:52:23.845 --> 01:52:25.975
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Rings started going nuts.

1251
01:52:25.975 --> 01:52:32.335
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Oh, okay.

1252
01:52:32.335 --> 01:52:36.454
Speaker 3 (Cornerstone): Where is my piece of cognition? Do I need to know what I'm going to.

1253
01:52:36.455 --> 01:52:37.955
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Yeah, that's like a nerdy feeling.

1254
01:52:37.955 --> 01:52:39.824
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yes, yeah. And it's all…

1255
01:52:39.830 --> 01:52:41.900
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): And then, literally, anyway.

1256
01:52:42.760 --> 01:52:45.500
Speaker 1 (Cornerstone): Why did you get the right in there, I think.

1257
01:52:46.310 --> 01:52:52.910
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Yeah, so we have this bond… We messaged. Months we can't figure it out. So it stays in it. Every Zoom room in the entire.

1258
01:52:52.915 --> 01:52:57.655
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): companies crashed recently at the same time, like, a couple times. Yeah, I said to restart it.

1259
01:52:57.655 --> 01:52:58.405
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): That's good.

1260
01:52:58.410 --> 01:52:58.790
Speaker 4 (Cornerstone): religious.

1261
01:52:58.790 --> 01:53:00.280
Speaker 2 (Cornerstone): Bye, Michael.

1262
01:53:00.285 --> 01:53:01.335
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): Michael's right now.

1263
01:53:03.320 --> 01:53:06.559
Speaker 6 (Cornerstone): Okay, so, okay. Yeah, you can do that.
