WEBVTT

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
the demo process, really want to see it.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:14.000
And we can get stuck just doing demos, and you don't want to pay for that. So…

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Um, because this is all…

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:20.000
This is all time being billed to, so I want to be sensitive to that.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.000
When it's appropriate, we'll show process maps and workflows.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
really kind of demonstrating the art of the possible.

01:06:25.000 --> 00:00:00.000
before analyzing the needs. So, there's, like, this preview of NetSuite that we walk through in that session.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:30.000
then we go into our analysis framework.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:37.000
And we have 4 steps there, so…

01:06:37.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Basically, current state. Now, we kind of know this already, but…

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So we're… we're trying to

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:30.000
find something that we don't know.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:51.000
it's a little bit investigative. We want you to explain how you do… how you're operating. We know you're on core, we're familiar with core.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:57.000
But you might be doing something different inside of Core that we haven't seen before, and I have run into this surprisingly.

01:06:57.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Um, I had a dealer who doesn't even… doesn't import a SIF file to a quote.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
They

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:30.000
don't do that. They don't do it until it's a sales order.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:08.000
And I was like, that scene look, Matt, that you just have?

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
That's the kind of look I had of that, huh?

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Um, I have wrapped my rounding grounded, but they had.

01:07:13.000 --> 00:00:00.000
their own reason internally why they did that, but those are the types of things that we're looking for.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Want to understand your objectives and strategy for that particular process area, because I'm also thinking you probably want to upgrade.

01:07:25.000 --> 00:00:00.000
During this implementation, so you probably have pain points that you're dealing with right now that you want NetSuite to solve. We want to make sure that we identify those.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Um, your requirements specifically, we'll be calling those out. You'll hear us.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:41.000
during our talk, we're doing it for the sake of the transcript.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:44.000
We'll say this is a requirement, and actually.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:50.000
The way our system works is when we say some of these key words, they get flagged in the transcript.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
And they can fold out, um.

01:07:52.000 --> 00:00:00.000
You'll hear us mention specifically as the requirement.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Whether it's functional or technical. And the difference there is functional means.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:04.000
You need to be able to do something in the systems.

01:08:04.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Technical means something needs to be built for you to do it in the system, whether it's an integration or a customization or things like that.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Trying

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:30.000
to identify all this stuff during our analysis.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:23.000
And typically, this is one and a half to two hours.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:31.000
And, um, you guys are gonna determine the attendees for each session. We recommend SMEs, we recommend that you're careful about who you.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:37.000
invite, um, I have been in sessions where it was just dominated by somebody who just kept asking questions.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Um, and that gets tough just because, again, this is all on your dime, so we want to be as efficient as possible.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
So, it might be, at times.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
appropriate for us to say, hey, let's take that.

01:08:47.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Offline, and we're more than happy to spend additional time with somebody.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
If

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:30.000
you did… if you deem it worth it.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:09:00.000
I did invite all of you based off of what was provided in the document to me.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:12.000
I think I got it right. I may have gotten it wrong, and if I got it wrong, I might be panicked dialing you to join, and I apologize for that in advance, but I think I got it right. But if I got it wrong, I'm sorry.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:16.000
I'll apologize now, and I will bring you in.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Uh, and in the meeting.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:22.000
And it also bears repeating that.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:26.000
Like, these next 3 days, we're hitting… I think we're hitting all the process areas.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:32.000
That is, like, kind of the first round of us going through the process areas. We only go a certain level deep.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
in that this first round.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:37.000
And part of it is we're identifying.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:40.000
topics that we need to go deeper in in future sections.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:44.000
And so, that's okay. If there's somebody who might not be in the meeting.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
We'll make sure that in the next event.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:49.000
And we'd probably end up doing that.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:52.000
two, three, maybe four?

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:56.000
rounds, sessions, depending on which process area needs the most attention.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:03.000
Until we get through, we feel like, okay, we've got all the requirements, we've had our side conversations about different topics.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:12.000
And then we're going to move on to the deliverables for this discovery process. So, our deliverables are, number one, a BRD, or business requirements document.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
for each process area.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:18.000
So all those process areas I need, they'll have a BRD for each one.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:21.000
We'll get that document to you, and you'll sit down with your team.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:27.000
Um, we'll do a quick walkthrough with it, um, but that is… that document is meant to be a collaboration, so…

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:31.000
We'll turn on review… we'll go into review mode, we'll turn on…

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:34.000
track changes. You guys will add comments, we'll answer.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
We'll have a back-and-forth conversation until.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
All your questions are answered.

01:10:38.000 --> 00:00:00.000
We might add things into the BRD that you want to see there, that's totally fine. Then eventually, you'll sign each BRD, and that really becomes our blueprint.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:30.000
for implementation. Any customizations that we identify.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:55.000
No matter how small or how large.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Even if that's just like, hey, I need… you need a simple saved search, or, you know, report inside NetSuite.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:07.000
It might only take us 15-20 minutes to make, it still needs to be documented, so we'll have solution designs for each one of those as well.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:13.000
Part of the artisan?

01:11:13.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And then, as I mentioned, those next sessions will be scheduled for the deeper functional analysis.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Alright,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:30.000
before I go into…

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:29.000
This next slide… I've been doing a lot of talking. Any questions up to this point?

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:32.000
West Coast Community Bank is covered in the bank feeds tab.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:36.000
Okay.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:43.000
envision the timeline for this discovery process with the 6 to 8 weeks you mentioned? Yeah, 6 to 8 weeks.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
I kind of give a range, because…

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:49.000
Until we know you guys, how fast you move, and how busy you are.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:52.000
It could go longer. It is one of those things where, like.

01:11:52.000 --> 00:00:00.000
It's not one of the areas you ever want to take a shortcut on the implementation, for sure.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
That's

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
important that we get it right. You mentioned

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
a lot of acronyms, I tried to write

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
them down. I'm

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
sorry, I hate

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
when people do that. EMR, or DRM? I might have screwed that

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
in. I was

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:30.000
like, that was the one I didn't hear. BRD? Business Requirements Document. Okay. BPQ, Business…

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
process questionnaire.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
DSP…

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:22.000
SMEF, subject matter expert. Oh, subject matter expert, yep. SOW, we know that one.

01:12:22.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Maybe I just read that down. Okay.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Thank

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
you for asking for clarification. I actually get frustrated when people use acronyms. I try not to do that.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So, uh… That's good jargon. Yeah, if

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I do

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
it, we'll start

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:30.000
throwing furniture acronyms at you.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Every, every industry is… and actually.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:53.000
I'm glad Gary and Janet are here. So, Gary and Janet, just so you know, like, a typical NetSuite implementation.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
is very difficult.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:13:00.000
As a consultant, you go into, you meet the client, it's usually a brand new industry.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:03.000
brand new client, you have no context at all.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:07.000
So their… their job is to learn the old industry, learn everything about the client.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:12.000
Uh, and then they move on, and they do it all over again in a totally different industry.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
all those acronyms, all the lingo, everything.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:20.000
Um, so the idea for a consultant that they could get into and do a furniture implementation.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:25.000
And then do another furniture implementation, then do another one. I'm a furniture expert, and.

01:13:25.000 --> 00:00:00.000
gain all that knowledge and expertise, and then keep using it.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Pretty excited? Yeah, it's pretty cool. Makes life a lot easier for consultants.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I'm just

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:30.000
trying to wrap my head around…

01:13:37.000 --> 00:00:00.000
But… and maybe we'll get to this later, but what are…

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
What are you looking for from each of the people here and the departments, and how can we best give you the information about.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
what we're doing in our workflows, and also, like, even future goals for how we might be using this. When does that get mapped out so we can understand what our time commitment is?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Yeah, that's, like, in these sessions, actually. Okay. We'll have specific questions that we ask to kind of pull that information from you. Okay. And you'll have.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
We want to hear from you. It's all about us.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:13.000
asking those questions and learning from you. Specifically, how you're doing it now.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:17.000
what your pain points are, what you're hoping that you're going to be able to change in this implementation.

01:14:17.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And whether it's in Phase 1 or in a future phase, yeah, that's going to be all these discovery sessions.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yep. You mentioned that you've already started some implementations. Have you found thus far that they…

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
those dealers operate

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
and work more similarly or more differently than you'd expect it.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Uh,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:30.000
my… my expectation going into it was…

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:46.000
that you guys are all doing the same thing, but doing it differently. And that's pretty much the case. So…

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:50.000
When we build the software, we built it so it was very configurable.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:55.000
So, it didn't force you to do things a certain way. So, um…

01:14:55.000 --> 01:15:01.000
Yeah, and so we built it so it can kind of be… it's pretty flexible. Yeah. Now, the good news is…

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:05.000
Well, Gary, let me ask you a question. When you do a typical implementation.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:08.000
How much, um…

01:15:08.000 --> 00:00:00.000
the requirements are covered by NetSuite natively versus how much do you have to customize on a typical… on an average implementation? Yeah.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Um, I did some pretty

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:30.000
good ones.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:24.000
pretty big implementations with manufacturing, so that's where the customizations typically come in.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:30.000
Those could be 50-50 if you do it mostly financials, um, a little bit less, because you've got.

01:15:30.000 --> 00:00:00.000
or functions that you're just looking to streamline a little bit with some workflows and automation and reporting.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Some

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:30.000
customizations are typically.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:43.000
a core part of a NetSuite implementation, like, up to sometimes 50% of the implementation.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:48.000
What we've done is we've kind of done all that ahead of time, right? We understand the business requirements, we built the software.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:53.000
And now, as we're going through discovery with dealers, we're looking at maybe, like.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:56.000
5 to 10%, I mean, it's so minimal.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:01.000
And it's usually just small, like, particular report here.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:04.000
Nothing structural to the software or anything like that, so…

01:16:04.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Um, so if you… if you need stuff flow, that's… I mean, like, we're used to doing a lot, so…

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
For us, this is, you know, for consultants and software, this is easier for us. I think for me, that's one of

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
the things I want to see, is that you guys are sharing with us best practices.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And then we can kind of evaluate our processes to what you're showing us, and kind of in the middle. NetSuite is

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:30.000
always evolving. I mean, they're always putting out releases and adding functionality, and that's where we stay up to date on the bleeding practices that NetSuite recognizes, which we guide them that way.

01:16:39.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Um, it's just there's sometimes specifically in manufacturing and some unique industries, where they're.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
there's

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
just tied to the way they've always done it, and so…

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
If we try to steer away that selection. And I

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:30.000
don't think we have a slide for this, but our…

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
Align Adapt.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:02.000
Dominique? I think we need to get a slide, but our… and we'll talk more about it in the session, but I'll give you kind of a preview of it.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:07.000
Our approach to this, when we're going through these sessions, is.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:10.000
The question that's going to be answered, and you'll see this all over the BRD.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:15.000
Are you… does your business process already align to what we have inside of Orion?

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:23.000
Or, do you need to adapt to our business process in Orion, or do we need to accommodate something for your business process?

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:29.000
The reason why we would… we want to be open to doing that accommodation is because you might be doing something that's unique.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
And that's causing you to win.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:35.000
And it's a… it's a strategic advantage. Well, we don't want to force you to do it.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:39.000
a certain way, and you lose that, we want to accommodate that.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:44.000
Even in the… even in those cases, and I can think of a handful of them with dealers.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
They're typically minor.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:49.000
And we're more than happy to do it. So, but…

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:53.000
Those are… those are the things we are on the lookout for. We don't want to pursue it.

01:17:53.000 --> 00:00:00.000
into a box that you could potentially lose that advantage.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:30.000
please temperate myself.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:06.000
Okay, so part of my role at KBM is to help our.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:13.000
project teams really communicate out to the world why we're amazing, why we're excellent, and then also.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:19.000
adapting and tailoring that message to what the client needs, and so much of what Orion seems to be.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:28.000
tells the story of operational excellence. So for me, our team, I really love to know what resources are available to us.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:45.000
Uh, to be able to kind of tell that in our own sort of narrative, and package it up in a way that aligns with what we do with Carlos, with brand direction in the KVM Hope way. So, I don't know if that's something that will come with fear, or maybe that could be part of another session.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:48.000
Um, but it's really important to us to…

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:52.000
have that source information, so we can package it.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:55.000
I'll let, uh, Chris…

01:18:55.000 --> 00:00:00.000
probably a session at some point.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
This

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:30.000
is kind of the marketing communication.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:08.000
guru here. Um, the other thing, you mentioned operational excellence, and I totally agree with you. The other big win, I think.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:15.000
for any client of your clients is the data security and privacy, especially in light of.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
everything that's been happening. Um, my kids are out of school this week.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:25.000
Because their school was hacked. Ransomware. And they only had 2 days of school last week, or no, they had a week, sorry, they had weeks.

01:19:25.000 --> 00:00:00.000
But yeah, so it just… it keeps happening, um, these hacks that keep happening that, um, Oracle.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
You

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:30.000
know, there's… there's probably…

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:38.000
probably one of the most secure platforms.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Has anybody impenetrable? No.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:45.000
But you want to reduce your risk as much as possible.

01:19:45.000 --> 00:00:00.000
having Oracle Data Centers does that. So, that's…

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I think a good part of the story, and for your clients. The other thing I think will

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:30.000
come out eventually, that we'll be able to feedback to you from these sessions is.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:03.000
when we go through those pain points, I believe that many of them will be linked to pain points that we've had with clients.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:08.000
So, like, I'm already thinking about the type of invoicing that we have to do for some specific.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:16.000
SOWs or MSAs, and, you know, right now that's a manual process. How do we make that a non-manual process? So then we can tell the story about.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:22.000
how easy and efficient we are to do business with because of… Yeah, exactly. And so, we'll be able to outline.

01:20:22.000 --> 00:00:00.000
specific wins for whoever the stakeholder is in that.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
position on the client

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
side. Well, that's my goal on

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:30.000
this… in all of this. Yeah, great.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
And I'll just share…

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:37.000
Before going into the NetSuite consulting full-time, my industry experiences.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:41.000
Operations Supply Chain Excellence, and that's what I was doing for you.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:44.000
for different industries, so I look at things from a…

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:49.000
from a lean operational accidental standpoint, that's just the way my brain works, and…

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:52.000
So I try to steer those conversations around.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:58.000
What are you… what are you trying to accomplish here? Especially on smaller companies growing into a NetSuite platform, or…

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:02.000
recently purchased by a new investor into private equity. Those are a lot of.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:05.000
what I've done, and it's a change. So, um…

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:10.000
So yeah, a little challenge the why.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
Very good. Alright, let's talk about the overall…

01:21:12.000 --> 00:00:00.000
implementation methodology.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
As I mentioned, we call it DREAM, uh, just because it's easier to remember.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And… Mark just loves this kind

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:30.000
of stuff. I do.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:32.000
So, discovery. Comprehensive business process analysis requirements calories. So that's what we're doing.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:38.000
You know, and just moving… one more statement about discovery, really, it's almost like a validation process now.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:45.000
just a typical discovery process is from scratch, like, I don't know anything about you, I need to ask every single question.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:51.000
Um, about you. And that's not what we're doing, really. We're… we know… we know you.

01:21:51.000 --> 00:00:00.000
We know what software you're on, um, we know your requirements. It's more about validating those requirements, identifying potential gaps.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Then we go into the realize phase, and this is where we start doing the system configuration. As I mentioned, or actually, as Matt mentioned, it's pre-configured system.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:13.000
So we have a suite of suite apps. I think there's 5 of them that we install into your account.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:19.000
And we begin the configuration process of that, because there is some configuration that needs to be done.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:22.000
One of the very first things I'll mention earlier is chart of accounts.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:25.000
You gotta get that in right away. We'll talk about chart of accounts today.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:28.000
And then any of the solution designs.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:33.000
that need to be worked on, that we identified during discovery, we'll start working on families.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:38.000
The realized phase is probably the lightest phase for you guys. We're…

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
We're happy, we're doing the majority of the work.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:44.000
So, we're going to spend a lot of intensive time with you during discovery.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:52.000
We're gonna kind of step away, do a lot of work during Realize. We will do a couple walkthroughs of the system with you, just so you can get familiar with it.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:59.000
So, with that, um, something to start thinking about now is, from an system administration standpoint.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:03.000
Um, start thinking about who that system administrator is going to be.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:09.000
There's a couple things. I think we got them?

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:12.000
Maybe if you have one or two, um, but…

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:18.000
start… you can start thinking about, like, understanding the platform, um, user roles and permissions, those are just…

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:22.000
some of the things we'll start talking about and walk you through during Realize.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:28.000
And then we move on to educate. That's the real heavy phase for you guys. That's where we're doing process walkthroughs.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:31.000
End user training, UAT.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:36.000
change management preparation, that's really heavy phase. That's the bulk of the implementation for you guys.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:40.000
The naturalize is when we go live.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
It's when we actually are live on the platform.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:48.000
And we will have a go-live strategy, but our best practice and our recommendation is.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:53.000
Not a hard cutover, but a date where you start doing new business in the system.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:57.000
Now, whatever projects you have in flight, in core, you run out.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:04.000
And… usually at this point, I hear, well, we have projects that go on for a year.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:08.000
And that is a problem. So…

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:14.000
We started to strategize about, well, are those phased? Is there a point where you can stop at a certain phase?

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
pick up the phase inside of NetSuite.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:22.000
Um, so hopefully there's just some… I'm just planting some seeds here, some things to think about.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:27.000
Um, but I'm sure you probably want to minimize how long you're paying for two licenses.

01:24:27.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So, some things to think about there. But I will just say, we really…

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
don't

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:30.000
recommend a hard cut over.

01:24:34.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Where you try and recreate all your projects in flight inside that suite. It is extremely difficult and time-consuming.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Um, to rebuild all that. Yeah. Can

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I break bad news right now, too, for everybody?

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:49.000
So, when we do cut over.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:52.000
Um, we are going to bring data from CORE.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:25:02.000
But it is not going to be as easy to go through as what you're used to finding as books. There's going to be an archive, you're going to have to go to that archive and pull up archival information.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
Uh, so I just want to put that out there now.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:12.000
Both in the morning process, go through the panic process, everything will be there, you will have it, but it will not be just like, boop, boop, boop, typing in a number in one.

01:25:12.000 --> 00:00:00.000
when don't it pop up the way you're used to seeing it?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
that's the reality of re-implementing.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
We're always maintaining

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
two systems in medicine.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
The

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
player

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
speaks a

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
lot of that duplication.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Like,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
that you've

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:30.000
been seeing.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:36.000
You mean for as, like, how long you run it out? Yeah. Yeah, like 6 months.

01:25:36.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Pretty typical, yeah.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Yeah, and if you have projects that go longer at that point, I would say, like, yeah, if you figure out a good place to cut that off, and…

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
And recreate a part of that.

01:25:47.000 --> 00:00:00.000
project. The other… the other challenge here is the financial consolidation.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:30.000
that's a real challenge. So…

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:58.000
Reimplementation is messy for, like, a year.

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:08.000
Because of that financial consolidation. So, Lorraine, it looks like you've already thought about that, and you've already accepted that. I've been through this a couple times. Yeah, okay, so you know.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:14.000
Uh, we will have a go-live checklist, um, it'll be up to you if you want to have us, uh, on site.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:20.000
Or go live, um, that's an option. Otherwise, typically what we do is we have, um.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:28.000
Our team opened up a Microsoft Teams channel and just leave it open all day long, so we're available to you, um, to help with that, um.

01:26:28.000 --> 00:00:00.000
If anything comes up during life.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And then maintain or maximize, I can't remember which one, I guess we're used to maintain, um, but kind of that ongoing support and the growing of your evolution on the platform.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:46.000
So, we do have a sweet care program, and that gives you, um.

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:50.000
Well, first, let me say, you have 30 days of.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:53.000
Postal life support, part of the implementation.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
After that 30 days.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:59.000
then you'll have to… it's some type of suite care.

01:26:59.000 --> 00:00:00.000
managed services for ongoing support, whether that's a bank of hours or managed services. We can talk more about that.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:30.000
But I can also tell you this, our philosophy is we want you two to be self… self-sufficient on the platform.

01:27:12.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So, we're not going to do things.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
in

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:30.000
such a way that, um.

01:27:17.000 --> 00:00:00.000
just to try and get billable hours out of you going forward. We really want you to own the platform and understand it.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
be able to operate in it. I

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
have to pay $250 to change my address?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:30.000
know sometimes I've heard things before it's hard to make.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:40.000
changes to reports and stuff like that. It's very easy in that suite. We're going to show you how to do all that.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:47.000
We're currently in Skype.

01:27:47.000 --> 00:00:00.000
All right, so… discovery phase. I think I've opened this up to 6 to 12 weeks, but I think we originally talked 6 to 8 weeks, but we're going to target.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
somewhere in there. And then

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:30.000
those other phases, everything else is TBD.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:03.000
And the reason why it's TBD is because, really, at the end of discovery.

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:10.000
we kind of reset expectations for the rest of the project. Once we kind of really finalized what's going to be in the project.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:13.000
So you'll have a project, um.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:16.000
scope document, you'll have the BRDs.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
You'll have the data migration strategy.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:26.000
Um, and then we'll have a really clear idea of when the go-live's going to be, and all these things in the timeline.

01:28:26.000 --> 00:00:00.000
and then some other information I've kind of already touched on.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:30.000
go into detail here.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:37.000
We don't have to go into any more detail. I talked about this a couple of times, but you'll have, um.

01:28:37.000 --> 00:00:00.000
access to this, uh, in PDF, so you'll have all this as well.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Project

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
plan, statement of work.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
business

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:30.000
requirements document, data migration strategy.

01:28:50.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So that is kind of the project kickoff.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
then we can move in at some point. I don't… what time did we have?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
The next session's 10.30. So we're a little

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
bit early, but let's open it up for some questions.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
other than CORE, what other things are we looking at this

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
replacement? We currently use, you know? So,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:30.000
other than core, it would also replace Zendesk.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:20.000
It would also, um, replace.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:24.000
Hopefully, any of the outsourced reports that we're doing manually.

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:29.000
The Excel reports, um, correct?

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:39.000
What's that? Keep working with documents. Workload documents would go away, project tracking sheets would go away, time entry would be incorporated.

01:29:39.000 --> 00:00:00.000
You're still running Asana, we would run project timelines through.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Um,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:30.000
NetSuite.

01:29:47.000 --> 00:00:00.000
But if we don't use Asana for timelines, which is for task management.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
We

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:30.000
would move all the task tracking into…

01:29:53.000 --> 00:00:00.000
That's sweet. What about RFP data?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
RFP data,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:30.000
we would still house outside of NetSuite.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:05.000
Things that we're creating ourselves, like marketing materials, or…

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:09.000
visuals or anything like that, we're gonna, uh, have that outside of bed.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
The hope is, is, okay.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:18.000
Uh, Shanna, I need a new order open, or a new project started for Intuit San Diego.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:24.000
Shanna creates a new, uh, project for me, and then, because that's a set account, we already know who the team is.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
the whole team is uploaded into that.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:29.000
We could also have a set.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:35.000
project list of tasks that need to happen, and those could be auto-assigned based off a role. Like, it just goes on and on and on.

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:45.000
If I'm Ravina, I can log into the… my dashboard, and I can see, oh, I have these new projects that need to be assigned based off of what was started. Like, it just…

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:59.000
All the crap… sorry, it's not crap. It is. All the minutiae that is in a Smyrna Excel spreadsheet, some are in a Google Sheet, some are in a Word doc, some are in a Google Doc, some are in…

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:07.000
on your desktop, some are… I don't know where the hell they are. Like, in a Zoom chat, like, all of that gets moved into a central location.

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:13.000
And we assign work and evaluate work based off of what's in NetSuite versus what's in an outside report.

01:31:13.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Because the outside report is only good as what somebody manually made it to be.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Um, time

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
tracking, billable hours, non-billable, all that data.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
All that data's in that suite.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
The

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
outside reports are not…

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
They're outdated as soon as you create them. They're not real-time. So if I

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
wanted to go look at hours, I don't know what the platform is, but we could have it set up where I go to that project number.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And on the top dashboard, it would tell me how many hours were sold, how many hours have been used, and what the amount of hours are left on it. And

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
you can still export this data to manipulate, right? You can do whatever we want with it, yeah.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
But

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:30.000
the goal is to…

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:56.000
They're going to present it to someone outside the system, sure, pull it, make it pretty, show it.

01:31:56.000 --> 01:32:00.000
But for us to, like, make decisions, we're gonna stay in that suite.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:07.000
Yeah. It's also going to attach to things, so right now we use Expensify, we might be looking at a different platform for expenses.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:13.000
But those connect to one another, so it reduces the workload. Because right now, when you submit an expense report.

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:21.000
KIP approves it, he downloads an Excel spreadsheet, Kevin uploads the Excel spreadsheet, and then manually matches everything so that it can be reconciled.

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:27.000
all the little things that we can't do with core, because Core says they're an open system, but they're really not an open system.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:31.000
Um, NetSuite will attach to whatever we want it attached to.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:40.000
The only caveat is, is everything we attach it to comes with a cost. So, it will do whatever we want. It's just like what we tell our clients. You can have whatever you want.

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:43.000
You're willing to spend the money to have it. Hey, Lobsterny go away?

01:32:43.000 --> 01:33:01.000
Payless does not go away. Yeah, we will keep HR separate. And that's what… I mean, Halosity might go away because we're evaluating different HR platforms, but there will be a paylocity-like system separate than NetSuite. Got it. Yeah. So will our documents still live in Drive? Our documents will still live in Drive, but you'll have the opportunity to link.

01:33:01.000 --> 00:00:00.000
the drive link directly into the project folder, so when you're in NetSuite, you could just click on the link and it'll take you to the project filter.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Right? Did I remember seeing that?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Am I making that part? I think it's actually a little bit better than that, because… you're talking about Google Drive? Yeah. Okay,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
so you guys aren't on SharePoint? Have you seen… have you found out that we're anti-Microsoft?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
There must be a certain

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
view story behind that, too, I'm kind of curious, but, um, do you mind, like, does it… Yeah, Billy…

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Integration Islam

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
is tight with it.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
when we're setting up folders, we could copy and paste the link directly in and have a spot where the link lives, and you can click the link,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I would imagine. Easily, but we have an even tighter integration where, like, the folder structure is visible inside NetSuite, and you can.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
bi-directional link, so you can, like…

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
As we go through discovery, maybe people will be more on board with SharePoint. I don't

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
know, I doubt it, but… Which is great, actually, I

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
had to double-check. All of our client-facing decks and all that we do in Google Slides and Google Suite, so we actually moved off of Box into Google Drive, so.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
That we're not paying for something twice, basically. Yeah. Well, boxes would say,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:30.000
oh my gosh. Yeah. And they're not…

01:34:14.000 --> 00:00:00.000
helpful. Alright, yeah.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So… For, uh,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
financial data, how far are we going back?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I love,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
um, historical records may be recorded.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Back

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
to, like, 2010, maybe.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Well,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
in this instance, it goes back to 2017. Yes.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
You have a cutoff?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So, the typical… and we'll have a whole session on data migration, but the typical process is end-of-the-month trial balances.

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:49.000
imported into the system for the past two to five years, but it's… they're just CSV imports. You can do tiny if you wanted to.

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
That's totally up to you. I mean, if it's…

01:34:51.000 --> 00:00:00.000
If you go back to 2017, I would… I would do all of it.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Back to 2017, so you have the period over period for

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:30.000
you. And we technically can go back to 2000…

01:35:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
teeth? They're like…

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
5? When did we switch to

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
4.1? No, no, it was…

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I don't know how far… We still have to…

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
We have the KBM workspace and the Hogan. Hopefully doesn't

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
go as far

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
back as ours did. Ours went back to 5, I believe.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
3

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
or 5. But, I mean, at that point, that information's just a liability. Access to that, so that

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
we can… We were

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
going to

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
export that

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
information, and it is going to go

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
to an archive, but it's not going to be through court.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Okay,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
that's fine, I just wanted

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
to talk about

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
you would be able to link it up.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
That's a

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
decision that Lorraine needs to make, and it's a finance leader of how much information she wants to hold onto. As someone who…

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
threw away a warehouse of paper two years ago? Like, I'm fine getting rid of everything we possibly can. We actually use

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
that data a

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
lot on the RFP side and on the interview side, when we have to make the case for, like, how much business we've done in a certain sector, or with a client, or…

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah, that's all gonna still be there. Okay. Yeah.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
That

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:30.000
kind of leads into a question I had. It's just not going to be…

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:18.000
In the same lookup, it's gonna be separate. Yeah, go ahead, Kim.

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:28.000
If it's too much… if it's something you want to divulge, you don't have to, um, obviously. How many of the implementations that you've done are core users, and.

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:38.000
I'm assuming that in that process, that CORE themselves will have to play some minor part in it, as much as we don't want them to. We do have access to the back end.

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:48.000
So we can avoid them as much as possible, but likely they're gonna… obviously, they're gonna know that this is happening, and they probably will have to be involved in some capacity.

01:36:48.000 --> 00:00:00.000
How many implementations have you done that, of course, people, and how willing to play ball were the core people?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
When they found out that this

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:30.000
was happening. Yeah, so probably about 80% are poor, and we have a strategy for how to ask for information from the core without.

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:10.000
tipping them off. So, and then we also have a tool that extracts some of the data from the core database, prep it for.

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:15.000
data migration. So, Joe Keller, um…

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
who's on our team has the tool, and he…

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:20.000
has a very specific way of reading the email.

01:37:20.000 --> 00:00:00.000
get access to the data. Are you guys on Core Web?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah, 4Web, yeah,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
we also have SQL in them.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Oh,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
uh, access. We have backdoor access. Oh,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
so you might

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
already be

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
able to set that? Yeah. Yeah. Because that's basically what you had in the past. We asked for that

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:30.000
when we were looking at integrating… what was the report software? Why did you look at, Kevin?

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:46.000
Yes.

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:51.000
Yeah, we had to ask for it because it's just one of the reasons we're making this change.

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:54.000
We needed access to the database because.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:38:04.000
it happens so frequently that we would need the most basic information from CORE, they could not get it. Yeah. So we have to go in the back door, pull it out, and then manipulate it.

01:38:04.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah, so I think you guys are already set, then, as far as… Good.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I don't think you're… I don't think you'll need any involvement with them.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I'll double-check with Joe, but… I have to go spend time with him in a few weeks, and I have to keep my mouth shut.

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:21.000
It's gonna be really interesting.

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:28.000
Okay. I would like to wrap up, just so we have a little break between sessions, but if anybody has any other questions.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:34.000
Um, please send them our way, we'll add them to the parking lot, we'll get a response back to you.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:38.000
either in your session that you're part of.

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:41.000
Or, uh, software, baby.

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:42.000
Thank you, everybody, for the time. Thank you, everybody. Thank you.

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:48.000
Thank you.
