## Session Overview

This session covered the overall project kickoff, methodology overview, and general implementation approach for the KBMH NetSuite/Orion implementation.

## Key Topics Covered

### DREAM Methodology
- **D**iscovery - Comprehensive business process analysis and requirements gathering
- **R**ealize - System configuration and solution design implementation
- **E**ducate - End user training, UAT, and change management
- **A**ctualize - Go-live and production deployment
- **M**aintain/Maximize - Ongoing support and platform evolution

### Discovery Process Framework
1. **Current State** - Understanding existing processes in Core
2. **Objectives & Strategy** - Identifying pain points and improvement goals
3. **Requirements** 
   - Functional (what needs to be done in the system)
   - Technical (integrations, customizations, etc.)

### Key Deliverables
- Business Requirements Document (BRD) for each process area
- Solution Designs for customizations
- Business Process Questionnaires (BPQ)
- Data Migration Strategy
- Project Scope Document

### Timeline & Approach
- Discovery: 6-8 weeks
- Multiple rounds of sessions for deeper analysis
- Align, Adapt, or Accommodate approach to business processes
- Go-live strategy: Soft cutover preferred (start new business in NetSuite, run out existing projects in Core)
- Typical parallel run: ~6 months

### Implementation Philosophy
- 80% of implementations from Core users
- Minimal customizations needed (5-10% vs typical 50%)
- Focus on operational excellence
- Self-sufficiency on the platform (not dependency on consultants)

### Data Migration Strategy
- Historical financial data: Typically 2-5 years of trial balances
- Core data extraction tools available
- Archive approach for old data (not readily searchable like current system)

### Systems to be Replaced
- Core (primary ERP)
- Zendesk (CRM)
- Excel/Google Sheets (manual tracking)
- Workload documents
- Project tracking sheets

### Systems to be Integrated
- Asana (task management) - may move to NetSuite
- Google Drive (document storage with integration)
- Expensify or alternative (expense management)
- Paylocity or equivalent (HR/payroll - remains separate)

### Post-Implementation Support
- 30 days of post-go-live support included
- Suite Care program available (managed services or bank of hours)
- Goal: Client self-sufficiency on platform

This kickoff session sets the foundation for all subsequent process-specific discovery sessions:

- **All Process Areas** - Understanding of overall methodology and approach
- **System Setup & Configuration** - Chart of accounts, subsidiary setup, user roles
- **Financial Management** - Data migration, period close, financial consolidation challenges
- **Order Management** - Quote-to-order conversion, project lifecycle management
