## Session Overview

This session focused on marketing operations, lead acquisition and management, RFP processes, and the intersection between marketing and sales functions at KBMH.

## Key Topics Covered

### NetSuite/Orion Marketing Capabilities
- **Email Marketing** - 120,000 emails/month included
- **Lead Capture** - Web forms embedded in website, automatic lead creation
- **Lead Management** - Routing, assignment, qualification
- **Segmentation & Targeting** - Contact database management
- **Duplicate Detection** - AI-enhanced duplicate management
- **Reporting & Analytics** - Dashboards, KPIs, campaign tracking

### Current State - Marketing Tools
- **MailChimp** - Current email marketing platform
- **Asana** - Marketing project requests and workflow management
- **Web Forms** - Contact us form (mostly cleaning quotes and small requests)

### Lead Sources & Channels
1. **Influencers** - Brokers, A&D firms, project management firms (primary source)
2. **RFPs** - Formal request for proposals
3. **Web Forms** - Online contact requests (low conversion, mostly service requests)
4. **Existing Clients** - Repeat business and relationship-based leads
5. **Manufacturers** - Partner referrals

### Marketing Team Structure & Workflow

#### RFP Process
1. Business development rep or account manager receives RFP opportunity
2. Opportunity tracked in Zendesk (varying levels of detail)
3. Formal RFP arrives from stakeholder
4. Formal project request submitted through **Asana** to marketing team
5. Marketing project manager schedules kickoff call with key stakeholders
6. Marketing tracks:
   - Projected volume vs actual volume
   - Resource allocation
   - Accuracy of estimates by requester

#### Marketing Project Request (via Asana)
- Background information
- Project links and documentation
- Projected volume
- Stakeholder identification

### Business Development vs Account Managers

**Business Development Reps:**
- Customer-facing, market presence
- Wining, dining influencers, brokers, clients
- Relationship building
- Lead generation focus

**Account Managers:**
- Project management after lead handoff
- Manage all project players and stakeholders
- Some also generate their own leads
- Variable role (some closer to BD, some closer to sales support)
- Skills-based flexibility

### Lead Management Workflow
1. **Web Form** → Lead creation
2. **Qualification** → Review by marketing/sales
3. **Assignment** → Routed to GM or existing client account manager
4. **Conversion** → Opportunity created in Zendesk
5. **Tracking** → Probability and value assigned
6. **Outcome** → Closed won (moves to Core) or closed lost

### Zendesk Current Usage
- Opportunity tracking and management
- **Not required** - Sales people may or may not use it
- Forecasting purposes for account managers
- Status: Stays in Zendesk until won/lost
- Integration: Manual movement to Core when won

### Marketing's Unique Role
KBMH's marketing department does more than traditional marketing:
- **RFP Response** - Creating proposals and responses
- **Sales Support** - Actually driving conversion, not just lead generation
- **Operational Excellence Messaging** - Packaging KBMH capabilities for client narratives
- **Brand Alignment** - Tailoring messages to client needs in "KBMH way"

### Pain Points & Improvement Goals
- **Inconsistent Data Entry** - Sales reps vary in Zendesk usage and detail
- **Manual Processes** - RFP tracking, volume projections
- **Resource Allocation** - Difficulty predicting project workload
- **Visibility** - Lack of real-time insights into lead status and pipeline

### Requirements Identified

#### Functional Requirements
- Lead capture from website (embedded forms)
- Automated lead routing based on account/territory
- RFP project tracking and workflow
- Volume tracking (projected vs actual)
- Pipeline visibility and forecasting
- Email marketing campaigns (replace MailChimp)

#### Technical Requirements
- Asana integration or replacement in NetSuite
- Web form integration for lead capture
- Zendesk data migration to NetSuite CRM
- Reporting for marketing project volume and accuracy

### Integration Considerations
- **Asana** - Currently used for marketing project requests; may move task tracking to NetSuite
- **MailChimp** - Migrate to NetSuite email marketing (120K emails/month capacity)
- **Web Forms** - Embed NetSuite forms on website
- **Zendesk** - Migrate opportunity data to NetSuite CRM
