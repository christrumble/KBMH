## 9. DECISION LOG EXCERPT

### New Decisions Detected During Analysis

**No new decisions** - This gap analysis reviewed existing documentation rather than conducting new discovery. All decisions were previously captured in Questionnaire v1.0 Decision Log.

### Decisions Requiring Validation/Completion

   - Decision needed: Draft PO approval process
   - Decision needed: Conversion criteria from draft to vendor PO
   - **Status**: Session ended before decision could be made
   - **Timeline**: Week 1-2 session

2. **Customer PO Tracking Approach** [PENDING - SESSION 2]
   - Decision needed: Custom record vs. custom transaction
   - Decision needed: Alert threshold percentages
   - Decision needed: Change order handling rules
   - **Status**: Flagged for separate session but not conducted
   - **Timeline**: Week 1-2 session

3. **Coupa Integration Automation** [PENDING - SESSION 4]
   - Decision needed: Automate now vs. future phase vs. manual
   - **Status**: Discussion deferred
   - **Timeline**: Week 2-3 session
   - **Decision factors**: ROI (time saved × volume), technical feasibility, email format reliability

4. **Spec Creation Tool Integration** [PENDING - FUTURE]
   - Decision needed: Pursue Configura/CET integration vs. external tool workaround
   - **Status**: Not in current scope per transcript
   - **Timeline**: Future phase consideration
   - **Decision factors**: Cost, timeline, user adoption impact, workaround burden

## 10. RECOMMENDATIONS

### 10.1 Session Sequencing Rationale

**Recommended Order**: Session 1 (Draft PO) → Session 2 (Customer PO) → Session 3 (Templates) → Session 4 (E-Portals)

**Rationale**:
1. **Session 1 first**: Unfinished discussion that was interrupted; Kipp has strong urgency on PO pain point; enables template work to begin in parallel
2. **Session 2 second**: Bank requirement makes it compliance-critical; longest design session requiring most preparation; finance stakeholder availability may be limiting factor
3. **Session 3 third**: Requires template recreation by GSI first (2 weeks); Kipp review and approval; can occur in parallel with Sessions 1-2 execution
4. **Session 4 last**: Decision-making session (automate vs. not); can inform ROI analysis while other sessions occur; lower technical dependency on other sessions

**Parallel Track**: Medium priority gaps (GAP-005 through GAP-010) can be addressed via email, short interviews, and document requests in parallel with the 4 main sessions.

### 10.2 Risk Mitigation

**Risk 1**: Finance stakeholder availability for Session 2
- **Mitigation**: Schedule Session 2 early in planning; offer flexible timing; provide comprehensive pre-work to reduce meeting time

**Risk 2**: Template recreation delays Session 3
- **Mitigation**: Follow up immediately on Kipp's template provision action item; allocate GSI resources for rapid recreation; begin work as soon as originals received

**Risk 3**: Coupa integration ROI justification unclear
- **Mitigation**: Prepare robust ROI framework in advance; gather Shannon's time data early; identify non-financial benefits (error reduction, scalability)

**Risk 4**: Stakeholder fatigue with multiple sessions
- **Mitigation**: Space sessions 3-5 days apart; keep to stated durations; show progress and value after each session; minimize required attendees

**Risk 5**: Medium priority gaps deprioritized
- **Mitigation**: Use asynchronous methods (email questionnaires, document requests); integrate into existing session agendas where possible; track action items rigorously

### 10.3 Change Management Considerations

**Managing Expectations**:
- Current 84% completeness is strong for a single discovery session
- Follow-up sessions are normal and expected
- Draft PO interruption was timing issue, not process failure
- Customer PO tracking complexity requires dedicated design time

**Stakeholder Communication**:
- Emphasize progress made (21 of 25 questions fully answered)
- Frame follow-ups as "detail deep-dives" not "missed topics"
- Show value of additional sessions (bank compliance, operational improvements, cost savings)
- Celebrate quick wins (template self-service, approval automation)

**Session Participation**:
- Limit required attendees to essential stakeholders
- Provide clear pre-work to maximize session efficiency
- Document and share outcomes immediately after each session
- Show cumulative completion progress

| FUTURE | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 (2%) |
| **TOTAL** | **32 (74%)** | **9 (21%)** | **2 (5%)** | **43 (100%)** |

**Analysis**:
- Heavy ALIGNS concentration (56%) - good news for implementation complexity
- ACCOMMODATE requirements focused on customer PO tracking (REQ-016, 017, 018), approval rules (REQ-023), integrations (REQ-040), and templates (REQ-029, 030)

## 12. CONCLUSION

The Order Management discovery is **84% complete with strong foundation** and clear path to 100% completion. The initial discovery session captured extensive detail on core transaction workflows, approval processes, tax management, and template requirements. 

**Four critical gaps** remain primarily due to:
1. Session timing (draft PO discussion interrupted by break)
2. Intentional deferral (e-portals discussion postponed)
3. Complexity requiring dedicated design time (customer PO tracking flagged for separate session)
4. Action items not yet completed (order type list, templates)

**Four targeted follow-up sessions** (6.5 hours total) plus document gathering will achieve 100% completion within 3-4 weeks. The high quality of information already captured (87% average confidence for answered questions) indicates excellent discovery process and stakeholder engagement.

**Key strengths** to maintain:
- Strong stakeholder participation from Shannon, Matt, and Kipp
- Evidence-based answers with specific examples and direct quotes
- Clear identification of pain points and desired outcomes
- Realistic approach classifications (ALIGNS/ADAPT/ACCOMMODATE)

**Key improvements** for remaining sessions:
- Engage Finance team more extensively
- Include IT Lead for technical discussions
- Keep sessions tightly scoped and time-boxed
- Document outcomes immediately after each session

**Readiness for next phase**: Upon completion of the 4 follow-up sessions and medium priority gap closure, the Order Management questionnaire will be ready for BRD generation with high confidence in requirements accuracy and completeness.
