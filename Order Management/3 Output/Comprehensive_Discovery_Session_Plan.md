## FACILITATOR NOTES FOR MARCUS

1. **Manage Time Strictly**: Use timer and transitions; 5-min warning before section ends
2. **Capture Decisions Immediately**: Write on whiteboard in real-time so group confirms
3. **Escalate Conflicts**: If group disagrees, defer to domain expert (Matt = approvals, Kipp = design, Finance = accounting, Shannon = ops)
4. **Stay Focused**: Note "future discussion" items but don't pursue them; keep focus on 5 main gaps
5. **Validate Understanding**: Periodically ask "Is my understanding correct?" to confirm
6. **Document Everything**: Take notes on what's said; record session if possible (with permission)
7. **Confirm Confidence**: At end of each section, ask "Are we at 85%+ confidence on this topic?"
