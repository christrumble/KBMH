## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Overall Completeness**: 87% of questions fully answered (improvements from v1.0)

**Progress Since v1.0**:
- ✅ **Draft PO Concept** - Partially addressed in follow-up session (moved from ❌ to ⚠️)
- ✅ **Questionnaire Confidence** - Enhanced with follow-up session evidence
- ⏳ **Customer PO Tracking** - Still pending dedicated design session
- ⏳ **E-Portals & Coupa** - Deferred discussion remains pending

**Critical Gaps Remaining**: 3 (down from 4)
1. **Customer PO Tracking Solution Design** [🔴 CRITICAL] - Requires 2-hour design session
2. **E-Portals & Coupa Integration** [🔴 CRITICAL] - Requires 1-hour discovery session
3. **Complete Order Type List** [🔴 CRITICAL] - Document request + validation

**High Priority Gaps**: 4
- Draft PO workflow details (partially addressed, requires design confirmation)
- Deposit management details
- Quote versioning practices
- Additional SO form fields

**Follow-up Sessions Needed**: 3 major sessions (5.5 hours total) + medium priority follow-ups

**Estimated Timeline**: 2-3 weeks to achieve 100% questionnaire coverage (reduced from 3-4 weeks)

**Key Progress**:
- Questionnaire completion improved through follow-up session
- Draft PO discussion partially advanced (still needs design workshop)
- Strong stakeholder re-engagement demonstrated
- Confidence ratings increased for several requirements

**Remaining Risks**:
- Customer PO tracking is bank requirement - design session critical
- Miller Knoll tiered pricing escalation pending (external dependency)
- Draft PO workflow needs formal design approval

2. **Template Submission** - Escalate to Kipp with deadline
3. **Draft PO Preliminary Understanding** - Leverage follow-up session progress

### 10.3 Risk Mitigation Updates

**Risk 1**: Draft PO concept acceptance [REDUCED]
- **Mitigation**: Follow-up session demonstrated strong interest; design session should move quickly

**Risk 2**: Finance availability [UNCHANGED]
- **Mitigation**: Schedule early; provide comprehensive pre-work

**Risk 3**: Coupa email format consistency [UNCHANGED]
- **Mitigation**: Prepare ROI analysis; gather Shannon's time data

## 12. CONCLUSION

**Progress Summary**: The follow-up session successfully advanced the discovery by:
1. Providing preliminary understanding of the draft PO concept (65% confidence)
2. Confirming stakeholder alignment on PO improvements needed
3. Re-engaging key participants (Kipp, Operations)
4. Elevating questionnaire from 84% to 87% complete

**Remaining Path to 100%**: Three critical gaps remain, but with strong pathway to resolution:
- **Customer PO Tracking**: High complexity but well-scoped for design session
- **E-Portals/Coupa**: Requires rescheduled discussion (initially deferred)
- **Draft PO Workflow**: Concept understood; design session will formalize

**Timeline Improvement**: Estimated completion accelerated from November 20 to November 15, 2025 (3-4 weeks → 2-3 weeks)

**Key Success Factors**:
1. Immediate follow-up on overdue action items (order types, templates)
2. Prioritize customer PO tracking session (compliance requirement)
3. Reschedule e-portals discussion (deferred from initial session)
4. Leverage draft PO preliminary understanding to accelerate design session

**Quality Assessment**: Discovery quality remains high with 87% completion and strong stakeholder engagement. No contradictions detected between initial and follow-up sessions.
