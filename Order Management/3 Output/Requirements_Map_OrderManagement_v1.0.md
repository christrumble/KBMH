# Requirements Map - Order Management
**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: 2025-10-16  
**Process Area**: Order Management

## Change Log
- **Date**: 2025-10-16
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Sources**: Master_Transcript_Order_Management.md (July 2025)
- **Summary**: Initial requirements map created from Order Management discovery questionnaire, capturing 43 requirements across transaction management, approvals, customer PO tracking, tax management, templates, order types, commission, and integrations.

## Implementation Approach Classifications

**ALIGNS**: The way the dealer is executing a business process in their current business system aligns with how they will do it in Orion. It might not be an exact one-to-one alignment, but it doesn't require any customizations for them to do what they are currently doing now in Orion.

**ADAPT**: They do need to modify their business process to use Orion. Adaptation is on a spectrum so it could be major or minor - but still no customization required.

**ACCOMMODATE**: WE will accommodate their business process by customization, personalization, new configuration - something we need to do to accommodate their needs.

## Notes

### Transaction Structure & Numbering (REQ-001 through REQ-005)
- **Change Management Critical**: "This is like the one thing during discovery that people get tripped up on"
- **Mitigation**: Project number stays consistent; global search; hyperlinked records; recent transactions dialog
- **Training Focus**: Search by project, not order number; email subject lines reference project
- **Timeline**: "Kleenex may be required, but we should be able to wipe our tears pretty quickly"

### Customer PO Tracking (REQ-016, REQ-017, REQ-018)
- **Business Driver**: Bank reporting requirement; payment delay risk mitigation
- **Complexity**: Multiple POs per project; change orders; blanket POs

### Integrations (REQ-039 through REQ-042)
