we need is, I think what we're going.","startTime":"04:33","endTime":"04:44","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"To do is set up an external.","startTime":"04:44","endTime":"04:45","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"SharePoint folder and give you guys access so you can upload the docs there and then anybody on our team has.","startTime":"04:45","endTime":"04:51","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Access to those docs.","startTime":"04:51","endTime":"04:52","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"It's just I'm going to be

Kim, just make sure it's not.","startTime":"05:23","endTime":"05:25","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":10},{"sentence":"In your personal sharepoint when you set it

document.","startTime":"05:31","endTime":"05:33","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"So let's talk about order types and special handling.","startTime":"05:33","endTime":"05:35","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I think transaction numbers after that.","startTime":"05:35","endTime":"05:38","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"But hold on a second.","startTime":"05:38","endTime":"05:43","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I'm sorry, these didn't get numbered.","startTime":"05:43","endTime":"05:46","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Well, Chris, Sorry.","startTime":"05:46","endTime":"05:47","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Talks amongst yourselves.","startTime":"05:53","endTime":"05:54","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"There we go.","startTime":"05:54","endTime":"05:55","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Sorry.","startTime":"05:55","endTime":"05:55","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"I found a topic.","startTime":"05:55","endTime":"05:56","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"One, nevermind, I got, is transaction numbering.","startTime":"05:56","endTime":"05:59","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Okay, so this is one of those areas.","startTime":"06:00","endTime":"06:02","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"There's probably like three different areas inside NetSuite that core users coming off a core kind of struggle with.","startTime":"06:02","endTime":"06:08","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"We talked about one on Friday and that is revenue and cost recognition and WIP accounting and things like that.","startTime":"06:08","endTime":"06:16","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"So I think we've talked through that.","startTime":"06:16","endTime":"06:17","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"We delivered the white paper.","startTime":"06:17","endTime":"06:18","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"You have some time to wrap your mind around that.","startTime":"06:19","endTime":"06:21","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"The other one is numbering.","startTime":"06:21","endTime":"06:22","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"And so core is a little bit different in the fact that you have a quote or, sorry, you have an.","startTime":"06:22","endTime":"06:27","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Order that has a state of quote and then order.","startTime":"06:27","endTime":"06:31","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And they're not, it's not separate transactions.","startTime":"06:32","endTime":"06:34","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"And NetSuite really deals with separate and distinct transactions.","startTime":"06:34","endTime":"06:38","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"So opportunity quote, sales order, multiple purchase.","startTime":"06:38","endTime":"06:46","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Orders, in our case actually multiple draft purchase orders and multiple purchase orders and then matching receipts and vendor bills.","startTime":"06:46","endTime":"06:54","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So there's actually a lot of transactions.","startTime":"06:54","endTime":"06:56","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"And we use our project record kind of as that umbrella record, so you can navigate across all of that.","startTime":"06:57","endTime":"07:03","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"So by just going to the project.","startTime":"07:03","endTime":"07:04","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Record, you'll have a list of all the transactions that are associated with the project.","startTime":"07:04","endTime":"07:08","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"The numbering, it is controlled by you to a point.","startTime":"07:09","endTime":"07:14","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"So typically what we do is we allow you to add a prefix to the number.","startTime":"07:14","endTime":"07:17","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"So like Opportunity, we might start with.","startTime":"07:17","endTime":"07:20","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"101 because you can, you could start your numbering sequence, but we might prefix.","startTime":"07:20","endTime":"07:25","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"It with op101.","startTime":"07:25","endTime":"07:28","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"And then quote, we might do qu101.","startTime":"07:29","endTime":"07:32","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Now what I've done in my own businesses in the past is I purposely have made those different.","startTime":"07:33","endTime":"07:37","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Different amount of numbers.","startTime":"07:39","endTime":"07:40","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So if OP is only three digits, my quote will be five digits, my sales order will be seven

great.","startTime":"21:00","endTime":"21:01","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And I think what we would do here, Matt, is we would include this in the software, so we

agreed.","startTime":"47:07","endTime":"47:08","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"As you say, we probably want to review it internally first because I'm not set on the way it

great.","startTime":"47:24","endTime":"47:27","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And the few ones that we had kind of loosely talked about were direct bill, intermarket,

automation.","startTime":"47:39","endTime":"47:40","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"That was coming from that.","startTime":"47:40","endTime":"47:41","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"You don't necessarily have to have an.","startTime":"47:42","endTime":"47:44","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Order type to do automation, by the

is.","startTime":"48:07","endTime":"48:08","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So maybe a good example of this would be for your Intuit work from

only.","startTime":"48:15","endTime":"48:16","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Is Intuit only doing work from

there just a subset of items?","startTime":"48:22","endTime":"48:24","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"But they're also not the only

mostly the ones doing work from home.","startTime":"48:31","endTime":"48:33","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Well, they are.","startTime":"48:34","endTime":"48:34","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Now we aren't doing any of the other

have.","startTime":"48:44","endTime":"48:46","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":10},{"sentence":"We have order with dealer service

Denning","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And it adds those lines versus having to have two different order types.","startTime":"48:54","endTime":"48:58","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Or like right now, every single order you start, no matter what it's called, brings a tariff line in.","startTime":"48:58","endTime":"49:03","speaker_name":"Matt

Denning","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Because we don't need a tariff line if it's just labor.","startTime":"49:08","endTime":"49:10","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So then you're adding that.","startTime":"49:10","endTime":"49:11","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You're adding a line for the sake of a line being there versus not if it's just going to be a zero.","startTime":"49:11","endTime":"49:15","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Now it's in the way.","startTime":"49:15","endTime":"49:16","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So there's nuances where I'd rather it.","startTime":"49:17","endTime":"49:19","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":10},{"sentence":"Be automated based off of what you put on the order versus what type of order you select, if possible.","startTime":"49:19","endTime":"49:25","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yes, yes.","startTime":"49:26","endTime":"49:29","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":6},{"sentence":"That's what we prefer as well, because the order

voided.","startTime":"49:32","endTime":"49:34","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":10},{"sentence":"Lines because they're just voided and sitting there.","startTime":"49:34","endTime":"49:36","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And they're in the way.","startTime":"49:36","endTime":"49:37","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"They drive me crazy too.","startTime":"49:38","endTime":"49:39","speaker_name":"Shanna Dollarhide","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"And you can't reorder them.","startTime":"49:39","endTime":"49:40","speaker_name":"Kip Herdrick","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They're just locked in once it's in

yeah.","startTime":"49:42","endTime":"49:43","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":6},{"sentence":"So we can never have those lines come in unless they're necessary.","startTime":"49:44","endTime":"49:47","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That would better.","startTime":"49:47","endTime":"49:48","speaker_name":"Matt

looking.","startTime":"49:52","endTime":"49:54","speaker_name":"MarcusDallacqua","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"So we'll take.","startTime":"49:55","endTime":"49:55","speaker_name":"Matt

what.","startTime":"49:57","endTime":"49:59","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Those order types are and minimize them.","startTime":"49:59","endTime":"50:01","speaker_name":"Matt Denning","speaker_id":10},{"sentence":"But then we'll also create a list of based off those orders that if and ors that would happen
